# How to: Add or Remove SharePoint Connections
  Server Explorer lets you browse SharePoint sites as well as data connections. However, before you can browse the contents of a SharePoint site you must add it to the **SharePoint Connections** node.  
  
### To add a SharePoint site to the SharePoint Connections node  
  
1.  On the menu bar, choose **View**, **Server Explorer**.  
  
2.  In **Server Explorer**, choose the **SharePoint Connections** node, and then, on the menu bar, choose **Tools**, **Add SharePoint Connection**.  
  
3.  In the **Add SharePoint Connection** box, enter the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_url](../VS_officedev/includes/tla2sharptla_url_md.md)] for the SharePoint site (for example, http://testserver/sites/unittests).  
  
### To delete a SharePoint site from the SharePoint Connections node  
  
1.  On the menu bar, choose **View**, **Server Explorer** to open **Server Explorer**.  
  
2.  Expand the **SharePoint Connections** node to reveal the SharePoint site that you want to delete from **Server Explorer**.  
  
3.  Choose the site, and then, on the menu bar, choose **Edit**, **Delete**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  This step doesnâ€™t delete the underlying site; it deletes only the connection from **Server Explorer**.
