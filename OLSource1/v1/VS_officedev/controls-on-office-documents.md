# Controls on Office Documents
  You can use the Office development tools in Visual Studio to add Windows Forms controls and *host controls* to Word documents and Excel worksheets. Host controls are objects that extend various user interface (UI) objects in the Word and Excel object models.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[appliesto_controls](../VS_officedev/includes/appliesto_controls_md.md)]  
  
 When you develop VSTO Add-in projects for Excel or Word, you can programmatically add these controls to any open document or workbook at run time.  
  
 When you develop document-level projects for Excel or Word, you can programmatically add these controls at run time, or you can use the Visual Studio designer to add these controls to the document or workbook in your project at design time.
