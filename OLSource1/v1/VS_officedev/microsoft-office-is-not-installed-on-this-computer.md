# Microsoft Office is not installed on this computer
  Visual Studio cannot find the Microsoft Office application that corresponds to the project type. If you are developing an VSTO Add-in project, this means that you cannot debug or run the project. If you are trying to create a document-level project, this means that you cannot create the project.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Install the Microsoft Office application associated with this project type, including the primary interop assemblies. For more information about supported versions of Microsoft Office, see [Configuring a Computer to Develop Office Solutions](../VS_officedev/configuring-a-computer-to-develop-office-solutions.md).
