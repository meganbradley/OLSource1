# How to: Build SharePoint Solutions
  Building your SharePoint solution is no different than building other applications in Visual Studio. For more information about building applications, see [Compiling and Building in Visual Studio](../Topic/Compiling%20and%20Building%20in%20Visual%20Studio.md). For a discussion of some considerations that are specific to SharePoint solutions, see [How to: Deploy and Publish a SharePoint Solution to a Local SharePoint Site](../VS_officedev/how-to--deploy-and-publish-a-sharepoint-solution-to-a-local-sharepoint-site.md).  
  
### To build SharePoint solutions  
  
1.  Decide whether you are making a debug or a release build. For more information, see [Debugger Project Settings](../Topic/Debugger%20Project%20Settings.md).  
  
2.  Choose the appropriate option for building or rebuilding your solution or project. For more information, see [Compiling and Building in Visual Studio](../Topic/Compiling%20and%20Building%20in%20Visual%20Studio.md).  
  
3.  On the menu bar, choose **Build**, **Build Solution**.
