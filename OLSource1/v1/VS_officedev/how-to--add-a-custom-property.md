# How to: Add a Custom Property
  You can add custom properties to the model by using the **Property Editor**. You can access these properties in code to retrieve information such as connection strings and other data at run time.  
  
### To add a custom property  
  
1.  In the **BDC Explorer**, choose the node that represents the model element to which you want to apply a custom property.  
  
2.  On the menu bar, choose **View**, **Properties Window**.  
  
3.  In the **Properties** window, choose the **Custom Properties** property, and then choose the ellipsis button (![ASP.NET Mobile Designer ellipse](../VS_officedev/media/mwellipsis.gif "mwEllipsis")).  
  
     The **Property Editor** dialog box appears.  
  
4.  In the text box in the **Name** column, specify the name of the property.  
  
5.  For the **Type** field of the custom property, choose the appropriate data type.  
  
6.  For the **Value** field of the custom property, specify a value, and then choose the **OK** button.
