# How to: Add and Remove Items to SharePoint Features
  When you create a SharePoint solution, Visual Studio adds the default SharePoint project items to your Feature. Before deployment, you can add and remove SharePoint project items to modify the SharePoint Feature.  
  
## Adding SharePoint Project Items to a Feature  
  
#### To add SharePoint project items with the Feature Designer  
  
1.  Open the Feature Designer.  
  
     For more information, see [How to: Customize a SharePoint Feature](../VS_officedev/how-to--customize-a-sharepoint-feature.md).  
  
2.  Add one or more items from the **Items in the Solution** list to the **Items in the Feature** list by performing one or more of the following steps:  
  
    -   Double-click each item that you want to add.  
  
    -   Choose an item that you want to add, and then choose the **Add** button (>).  
  
    -   Choose the **Add All** button (>>).  
  
     The SharePoint Project Items appear in the **Items in the Feature** list.  
  
## Removing SharePoint Project Items from a Feature  
  
#### To remove SharePoint Items with the Feature Designer  
  
1.  Choose one or more items in the **Items in the Feature** list.  
  
2.  Choose the **Remove** button (<) to remove one item at a time, or choose the **Remove All** button (<<) to remove all items.  
  
     The SharePoint Project Items appear in the **Items in the Solution** list.
