# How to: Install Office Primary Interop Assemblies
  Install the Microsoft Office primary interop assemblies (PIAs) when you install Office.  
  
### To install the PIAs when you install Office  
  
1.  Ensure that you have a version of the .NET Framework that is no older than 2.0.  
  
2.  Install Microsoft Office and make sure that the **.NET Programmability Support** feature is selected for the applications you want to extend (this feature is included in the default installation).  
  
    > [!WARNING]  
    >  By default, PIA’s are embedded in your solution when you build it so you don’t have to distribute PIAs to users as a prerequisite to using your VSTO Add-in or customization.
