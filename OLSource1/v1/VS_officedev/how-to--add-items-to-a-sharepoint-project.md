# How to: Add Items to a SharePoint Project
  SharePoint solutions contain one or more projects, each of which contains multiple SharePoint project items. After you open or create a SharePoint solution, you can add either new or existing items to these projects. For example, new workflow projects come with a default form thatâ€™s named default.aspx, but you can replace that form with a new or different form, or add another ASPX form.  
  
### To add a new project item to a SharePoint solution  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../VS_officedev/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], open or create a SharePoint solution.  
  
2.  In **Solution Explorer**, choose the project's node.  
  
3.  On the menu bar, choose **Project**, **Add New Item** to display the **Add New Item** dialog box.  
  
4.  In the **Installed Templates** list, expand the **SharePoint** node, and then choose the **2010** node.  
  
5.  In the list of project item templates, choose a template.  
  
6.  In the **Name** text box, enter a name, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
### To add an existing project item to a SharePoint solution  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../VS_officedev/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], open or create a SharePoint solution.  
  
2.  In **Solution Explorer**, choose the project's node.  
  
3.  On the menu bar, choose **Project**, **Add Existing Item** to display the **Add Existing Item** dialog box.  
  
4.  Browse to the folder that contains the item that you want to add, choose it, and then choose the **Add** button.
