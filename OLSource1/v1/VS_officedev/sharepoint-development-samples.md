# SharePoint Development Samples
  You can use Visual Studio to download and install samples of SharePoint applications from the [MSDN Code Gallery](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=254185).  
  
 You can download each sample individually, or you can download a Sample Pack, which contains related samples that share a technology or topic. Youâ€™ll receive a notification when source code changes are published for any sample that you download.
