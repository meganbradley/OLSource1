# How to: Create a BDC Model
  You can create a Business Data Connectivity (BDC) model by using the template for that kind of item and then adding the model to any SharePoint project. For more information, see [Creating a Business Data Connectivity Model](../VS_officedev/creating-a-business-data-connectivity-model.md). For more information about how to design the model, see [Designing a Business Data Connectivity Model](../VS_officedev/designing-a-business-data-connectivity-model.md).  
  
### To create a BDC project  
  
1.  On the menu bar, choose **File**, **New**, **Project**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If your IDE is set to use Visual Basic development settings, choose **File**, **New Project**.  
  
     The **New Project** dialog box opens.  
  
2.  Under either **Visual Basic** or **Visual C#**, choose **Office/SharePoint**, **SharePoint Solutions**.  
  
3.  In the **Templates** pane, choose the **SharePoint 2013 â€“ Empty Project** item, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
     The **SharePoint Customization Wizard** opens.  
  
4.  On the **Specify the site and security level for debugging** page, specify the URL of a SharePoint site on the local computer, choose the **Deploy as farm solution** option button, and then choose the **Finish** button.  
  
     You will test the model on the SharePoint site that you specified.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  You must deploy the project as a farm solution because BDC models support only farm solutions.  
  
     An empty SharePoint project is created.  
  
5.  On the menu bar, choose **Project**, **Add New Item**.  
  
6.  In the **Add New Item** dialog box, choose the **Office/SharePoint** node.  
  
7.  In the list of SharePoint templates, choose **Business Data Connectivity Model (Farm Solution Only)**.  
  
8.  In the **Name** box, specify a name for the BDC model, and then choose the **Add** button.  
  
     A **Business Data Connectivity Model** item is added to the project. By default, the model appears in the BDC designer. For more information, see [Creating a Business Data Connectivity Model](../VS_officedev/creating-a-business-data-connectivity-model.md).
