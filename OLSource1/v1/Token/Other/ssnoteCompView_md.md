  This SQL Server 2000 system table is included as a view for backward compatibility. We  recommend that you use the current SQL Server system views instead. To find the equivalent system view or views, see [Mapping System Tables to System Views &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../Topic/Mapping%20System%20Tables%20to%20System%20Views%20\(Transact-SQL\).md). This feature will be removed in a future version of Microsoft SQL Server. Avoid using this feature in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use this feature.
