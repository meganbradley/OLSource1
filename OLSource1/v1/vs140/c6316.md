# C6316
warning C6316: Incorrect operator: tested expression is constant and non-zero. Use bitwise-and to determine whether bits are set  
  
 This warning indicates the use of bitwise-or (<CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>) when bitwise-and (<CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>) should have been used. Bitwise-or adds bits to the resulting expression, whereas bitwise-and selects only those bits in common between its two operators. Tests for flags must be performed with bitwise-and or a test of equality.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 To correct this warning, use the following code:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
