# Demotion of Integers
**ANSI 3.2.1.2** The result of converting an integer to a shorter signed integer, or the result of converting an unsigned integer to a signed integer of equal length, if the value cannot be represented  
  
 When a **long** integer is cast to **a short**, or a **short** is cast to a <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, the least-significant bytes are retained.  
  
 For example, this line  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 assigns the value 0x5678 to <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, and this line  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 assigns the value 0x34 to <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>.  
  
 When signed variables are converted to unsigned and vice versa, the bit patterns remain the same. For example, casting â€“2 (0xFE) to an unsigned value yields 254 (also 0xFE).
