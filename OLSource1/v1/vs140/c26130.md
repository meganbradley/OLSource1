# C26130
warning C26130: Missing annotation _Requires_lock_held\_(\<lock>) or _No_competing_thread\_ at function \<func>. Otherwise it could be a race condition. Variable \<var> should be protected by lock \<lock>.  
  
 Warning C26130 is issued when the analyzer detects a potential race condition but infers that the function is likely to be run in a single threaded mode, for example, when the function is in the initialization stage based on certain heuristics.  
  
## Example  
 In the following example, warning C26130 is generated because a <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> member is being modified without a lock.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
## Example  
 If the previous code is guaranteed to be operated in a single threaded mode, annotate the function by using <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, as shown in the following example.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
## Example  
 Alternatively, you can annotate a code fragment by using <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> and <CodeContentPlaceHolder>6\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, as follows.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
