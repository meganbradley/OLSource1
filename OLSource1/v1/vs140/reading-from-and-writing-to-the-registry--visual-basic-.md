# Reading from and Writing to the Registry (Visual Basic)
This topic describes task and conceptual topics that are associated with the registry.  
  
 When programming in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)], you can choose to access the registry by means of either the functions provided by [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] or the registry classes of the .NET Framework. The registry hosts information from the operating system as well as information from applications hosted on the machine. Working with the registry may compromise security by allowing inappropriate access to system resources or protected information.
