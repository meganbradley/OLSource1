# C6517
warning C6517: Invalid annotation: 'SAL_readableTo' property may not be specified on buffers that are not readable: '_Param\_(1)'.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This warning occurs only in code that is using a deprecated version of the source-code annotation language (SAL). We recommend that you port your code to use the latest version of SAL. For more information, see [Using SAL Annotations to Reduce C/C++ Code Defects](../vs140/using-sal-annotations-to-reduce-c-c---code-defects.md).  
  
 This warning indicates that <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> property does not have the required read access. You cannot use this property to annotate a parameter without providing read access.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning because read access is not granted on the buffer:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 To correct this warning, grant read access as shown in the following code:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
