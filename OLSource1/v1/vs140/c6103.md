# C6103
warning C6103: Returning \<variable> from failed function call at line \<location>.  
  
 A successful path through the function is returning a variable that was used as an <CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> parameter to an internal function call that failed.  
  
 The problem might be that the called function and the calling function are not completely annotated. The called function may require <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> (<CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> for COM code), or a related annotation, and the calling function may require a <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> annotation. Another possible cause for this warning is that the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> annotation on the called function is incorrect.
