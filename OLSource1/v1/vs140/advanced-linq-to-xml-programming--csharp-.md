# Advanced LINQ to XML Programming (C#)
This section provides information that will only be applicable to advanced developers in certain [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../vs140/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)] scenarios.  
  
## In This Section  
  
|Topic|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[LINQ to XML Annotations](../vs140/linq-to-xml-annotations3.md)|Describes how to add annotations to [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../vs140/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)] nodes and attributes.|  
|[LINQ to XML Events (C#)](../vs140/linq-to-xml-events--csharp-.md)|Describes how to write event handlers for events that occur when you alter an XML tree.|  
|[Programming with Nodes (C#)](../vs140/programming-with-nodes--csharp-.md)|Describes how to query and manipulate nodes at a finer level of granularity than elements and attributes.|  
|[Mixed Declarative Code/Imperative Code Bugs (LINQ to XML) (C#)](../vs140/mixed-declarative-code-imperative-code-bugs--linq-to-xml---csharp-.md)|Describes the problems that appear when you mix declarative code (queries) with imperative code (code that modifies the XML tree).|  
|[How to: Stream XML Fragments with Access to Header Information (C#)](../vs140/how-to--stream-xml-fragments-with-access-to-header-information--csharp-.md)|Describes how to stream XML fragments from an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader*>. You can use this technique to control the memory footprint of your application.|  
|[How to: Perform Streaming Transform of Large XML Documents (C#)](../vs140/how-to--perform-streaming-transform-of-large-xml-documents--csharp-.md)|Describes how to stream XML from an <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader*>, transform the XML fragment, and stream the output using <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XStreamingElement*>.|  
|[How to: Read and Write an Encoded Document (C#)](../vs140/how-to--read-and-write-an-encoded-document--csharp-.md)|Describes how to read and write XML documents that are encoded.|  
|[Using XSLT to Transform an XML Tree (C#)](../vs140/using-xslt-to-transform-an-xml-tree--csharp-.md)|Describes how to transform an XML tree using XSLT.|  
|[How to: Use Annotations to Transform LINQ to XML Trees in an XSLT Style (C#)](../vs140/how-to--use-annotations-to-transform-linq-to-xml-trees-in-an-xslt-style--csharp-.md)|Describes how annotations can be used to facilitate transforms of an XML tree.|  
|[Serializing Object Graphs that Contain XElement Objects (C#)](../vs140/serializing-object-graphs-that-contain-xelement-objects--csharp-.md)|Describes how to serialize object graphs that contain <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement*> and <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XDocument*> objects.|  
|[WPF Data Binding with LINQ to XML](../vs140/wpf-data-binding-with-linq-to-xml.md)|Describes how to use LINQ to XML as the data source for data binding in Windows Presentation Foundation applications.|
