# How to: Query the Contents of Files in a Folder (LINQ) (C#)
This example shows how to query over all the files in a specified directory tree, open each file, and inspect its contents. This type of technique could be used to create indexes or reverse indexes of the contents of a directory tree. A simple string search is performed in this example. However, more complex types of pattern matching can be performed with a regular expression. For more information, see [How to: Combine LINQ Queries with Regular Expressions (C#)](../vs140/how-to--combine-linq-queries-with-regular-expressions--csharp-.md).  
  
## Example  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
## Compiling the Code  
 Create a project that targets the .NET Framework  version 3.5 or higher, with a reference to System.Core.dll and <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> directives for the System.Linq and System.IO namespaces.
