# Anonymous type member property &#39;&lt;propertyname&gt;&#39; cannot be used to infer the type of another member property because the type of &#39;&lt;propertyname&gt;&#39; is not yet established
Until the type of an anonymous type property is established, it cannot be used to establish the type of another property. For example, in the following declaration <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> is not valid because <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> has not yet been initialized.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 **Error ID:** BC36559  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Establish the type of the property before using it to initialize another property.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
