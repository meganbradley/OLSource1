# Extending the Toolbox
The [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] **Toolbox** provides a collection of objects that provide functionality to editors and designers through the IDE's drag-and-drop mechanism.  
  
 There are two basic ways in which a VSPackage works with the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] **Toolbox**:  
  
-   A VSPackage can add new data items and controls to the **Toolbox**.  
  
-   A VSPackage can be a target or consumer of existing **Toolbox** functionality, supporting the drag-and-drop operations and configuring the **Toolbox**'s appearance.
