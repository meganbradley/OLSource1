# C6237
warning C6237: (\<zero> && \<expression>) is always zero. \<expression> is never evaluated and may have side effects  
  
 This warning indicates that a constant value of zero was detected on the left side of a logical-and operation that occurs in a test context. The resulting expression always evaluates to false. Therefore, the right side of the logical-AND operation is not evaluated. This is referred to as "short-circuit evaluation."  
  
 You should examine the right side of the expression carefully to ensure that any side effects such as assignment, function call, increment, and decrement operations needed for proper functionality are not affected by the short-circuit evaluation.  
  
 The expression (<CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>) produces no side effects and is commonly used to selectively choose code paths.  
  
## Example  
 The following code shows various code samples that generate this warning:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 To correct this warning, use the following code:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
