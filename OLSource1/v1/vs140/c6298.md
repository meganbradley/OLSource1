# C6298
warning C6298: using a read-only string \<pointer> as a writable string argument: this will attempt to write into static read-only memory and cause random crashes  
  
 This warning indicates the use of a constant string as an argument to a function that might modify the contents of that string. Because the compiler allocates constant strings in a static read-only memory, any attempts to modify it cause access violations and random crashes.  
  
 This can be avoided by storing the constant string into a local array and then using the array as the argument to the function.  
  
## Example  
 The following sample code generates this warning:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 To correct this warning, use the following sample code:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
