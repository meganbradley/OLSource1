# C6313
warning C6313: Incorrect operator: Zero-valued flag cannot be tested with bitwise-and. Use an equality test to check for zero-valued flags  
  
 This warning indicates that a constant value of zero was provided as an argument to the bitwise-and (<CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>) operator in a test context. The resulting expression is constant and evaluates to false; the result is different than intended.  
  
 This is typically caused by using bitwise-and to test for a flag that has the value zero. To test zero-valued flags, a test for equality must be performed, for example, using <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> or <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 To correct this warning, use the following code:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
