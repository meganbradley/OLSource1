# WsdlService Type Provider (F#)
Provides the types for a WSDL (Web Services Description Language) web service.  
  
 **Namespace/Module Path:** Microsoft.FSharp.Data.TypeProviders  
  
 **Assembly:** FSharp.Data.TypeProviders (in FSharp.Data.TypeProviders.dll)  
  
## Syntax  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
## Static Type Parameters  
  
|Type Parameter|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|ServiceUri : string|The URI for the web service.|  
|?LocalSchemaFile : string|A .wsdlschema file to store locally cached service schema.|  
|?ForceUpdate : bool|Requires that a direct connection to the service is available at design-time and force the refresh of the local schema file. The default is true. When <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> is false, the provider reacts to changes in the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>.|  
|?MessageContract : bool|If <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, generates Message Contract types. The default value is <CodeContentPlaceHolder>6\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>.|  
|?EnableDataBinding : bool|If true, the generated Data Contract types implement the \<xref:System.ComponentModel.INotifyPropertyChanged*> interface to enable data binding.|  
|?Serializable : bool|If <CodeContentPlaceHolder>7\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, the generated types are serializable. The default is <CodeContentPlaceHolder>8\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>. If this is set to true, the generated types have the Serializable attribute applied.|  
|?Async : bool|If <CodeContentPlaceHolder>9\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, generates both synchronous and asynchronous method signatures. The default value is <CodeContentPlaceHolder>10\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>.|  
|?CollectionType : string|A fully qualified or assembly-qualified name of the type to use as a collection data type when code is generated from schemas.|  
  
## Remarks  
 For a walkthrough that shows how to use this type provider, see [How To: Access Typed Data from a Web Service (F#)](../vs140/walkthrough--accessing-a-web-service-by-using-type-providers--fsharp-.md).  
  
## About WSDL  
 WSDL  is an XML-based language for describing web services. Web services expose method calls or function calls over a network and, in the case of WSDL, the Internet. WSDL is used by services to provide a description of the function calls available on the service and the associated data types. The WSDL type provider allows you to use data types from any WSDL service immediately in your code, without the usual overhead of creating them for each service.  
  
 A WSDL document contains the description for a web service. WSDL documents are in the XML format and contain definitions of the interfaces and operations offered, the messages and data types used, and information about networking endpoints, such as the URIs, ports, and protocols used. A WSDL document has two major sections, the abstract definitions of the interfaces, their types, operations, and messages, and the bindings section.  
  
 WSDL interfaces, also known as portTypes, are groupings of operations. Operations are like methods on an interface. Operations, like methods, can have parameters and return values. The operations are described in the WSDL document in an abstract form that is not specific to the protocol used. The bindings section of the WSDL document describes how the interfaces are exposed as web services, through a specific endpoint, or port and protocol. The protocol used with WSDL is typically SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) over HTTP. The SOAP protocol provides a way of encoding object-oriented types and methods.  
  
 WSDL 2.0 is a significant revision of the WSDL protocol.

## About the WSDL Type Provider  
 The WSDL type provider allows you to program against a web service with a set of auto-generated types. Behind the scenes, the compiler runs <CodeContentPlaceHolder>11\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> to generate types that you can use to access the web service. They are generated by declaring the type provider in F# code for the service. The following lines of code illustrate this:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 The service object hides the details of the SOAP protocol and exposes the functionality of the web server to client code. The service object is referred to as a SOAP client because its job is to interact with the server by using the SOAP protocol to call web service operations. It is analogous to the types created by running wsdl.exe and inherits from <xref:System.ServiceModel.ClientBase<CodeContentPlaceHolder>12\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>DataContractOnly<CodeContentPlaceHolder>13\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>EnableDataBinding<CodeContentPlaceHolder>14\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>MessageContract<CodeContentPlaceHolder>15\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>Async<CodeContentPlaceHolder>16\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>CollectionType<CodeContentPlaceHolder>17\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>DataContractSerializer<CodeContentPlaceHolder>18\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>svcutil.exe<CodeContentPlaceHolder>19\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>WsdlService<CodeContentPlaceHolder>20\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>ServiceTypes<CodeContentPlaceHolder>21\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>System.ServiceModel<CodeContentPlaceHolder>22\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>WsdlService<CodeContentPlaceHolder>23\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>System.Runtime.Serialization<CodeContentPlaceHolder>24\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>ServiceTypes<CodeContentPlaceHolder>25\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>WsdlService` type provider to call a method on a web service, in this case, the [TerraServer](http://www.terraserver.com/) site published by Microsoft Research.
