# String constants must end with a double quote
String constants must begin and end with quotation marks.  
  
 **ErrorID:** BC30648  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Make sure the string literal ends with a quotation mark ("). If you paste values from other text editors, make sure the pasted character is a valid quotation mark and not one of the characters that resemble it, such as "smart" or "curly" quotation marks (" or ") or two single quotation marks ('').
