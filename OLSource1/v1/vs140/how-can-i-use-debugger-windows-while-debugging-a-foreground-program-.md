# How Can I Use Debugger Windows While Debugging a Foreground Program?
## Problem Description  
 I am trying to debug a screen-painting problem. To observe this problem, I have to keep my program in the foreground, which means I do not have access to the debugging windows. What can I do?  
  
## Solution  
 If you have a second computer, you can use remote debugging. With a two-computer setup, you can watch the screen painting on the remote computer while you operate the debugger on the host. For more information on remote debugging, see [Setting Up Remote Debugging](../vs140/set-up-the-remote-tools-on-the-device.md).
