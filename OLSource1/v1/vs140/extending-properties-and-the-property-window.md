# Extending Properties and the Property Window
The **Properties** window is used to view and edit the design-time properties and events of selected objects.  
  
 When you select an object in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], the public properties of that object appear in the **Properties** window. For more information, see [Properties Window Overview](../vs140/properties-window-overview.md).

 Explains how you can have your custom properties displayed in the Properties window.  
  
 [Getting Project Properties](../vs140/getting-project-properties.md)
