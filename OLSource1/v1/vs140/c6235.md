# C6235
warning C6235: (\<non-zero constant> &#124;&#124; \<expression>) is always a non-zero constant  
  
 This warning indicates that a non-zero constant value, other than one, was detected on the left side of a logical-or operation that occurs in a test context. The right side of the logical-or operation is not evaluated because the resulting expression always evaluates to true. This is referred to as "short-circuit evaluation."  
  
 A non-zero constant value, other than one, suggests that the bitwise-AND operator (<CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>) may have been intended. This warning is not generated for the common idiom when the non-zero constant is 1, because of its use for selectively enabling code paths, but it is generated if the non-zero constant evaluates to 1, for example 1+0.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning because <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> is 2:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 The following code uses the bitwise-AND (<CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>) operator to correct this warning:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
