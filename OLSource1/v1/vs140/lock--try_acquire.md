# lock::try_acquire
Acquires a lock on an object, waiting for a specified amount of time and returning a <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> to report the success of acquisition instead of throwing an exception.  
  
## Syntax  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
#### Parameters  
 <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 Timeout value in milliseconds or as a \<xref:System.TimeSpan*>.  
  
## Return Value  
 <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> if lock was acquired, <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> otherwise.  
  
## Remarks  
 If a lock has already been acquired, this function does nothing.  
  
## Example  
 This example uses a single instance of a class across multiple threads.  The class uses a lock on itself to ensure that accesses to its internal data are consistent for each thread.  The main application thread uses a lock on the same instance of the class to periodically check to see if any worker threads still exist, and waits to exit until all worker threads have completed their tasks.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 **In thread 3, Counter = 0**  
**In thread 3, Counter = 10**  
**In thread 5, Counter = 0**  
**In thread 5, Counter = 10**  
**In thread 7, Counter = 0**  
**In thread 7, Counter = 10**  
**In thread 4, Counter = 0**  
**In thread 4, Counter = 10**  
**In thread 6, Counter = 0**  
**In thread 6, Counter = 10**  
**All threads completed.**   
## Requirements  
 **Header file** \<msclr\lock.h>  
  
 **Namespace** msclr
