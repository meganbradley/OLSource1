# Sample Makefile for PCH
The following makefile uses macros and an !IF, !ELSE, !ENDIF flow-of-control command structure to simplify its adaptation to your project.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 Aside from the STABLEHDRS, BOUNDRY, and UNSTABLEHDRS macros shown in the figure "Structure of a Makefile That Uses a Precompiled Header File" in [PCH Files in the Build Process](../vs140/pch-files-in-the-build-process.md), this makefile provides a CLFLAGS macro and a LINKFLAGS macro. You must use these macros to list compiler and linker options that apply whether you build a debug or final version of the application's executable file. There is also a LIBS macro where you list the libraries your project requires.  
  
 The makefile also uses !IF, !ELSE, !ENDIF to detect whether you define a DEBUG symbol on the NMAKE command line:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 This feature makes it possible for you to use the same makefile during development and for the final versions of your program â€” use DEBUG=0 for the final versions. The following command lines are equivalent:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 For more information on makefiles, see [NMAKE Reference](../vs140/nmake-reference.md). Also see [Compiler Options](../vs140/compiler-options.md) and the [Linker Options](../vs140/linker-options.md).
