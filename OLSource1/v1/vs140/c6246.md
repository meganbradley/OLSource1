# C6246
warning C6246: Local declaration of \<variable> hides declaration of same name in outer scope. Additional Information: See previous declaration at \<location>.  
  
 This warning indicates that two declarations have the same name at local scope. The name at outer scope is hidden by the declaration at the inner scope. Any intended use of the outer scope declaration will result in the use of local declaration.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 To correct this warning, use another variable name as shown in the following code:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 This warning only identifies a scope overlap.
