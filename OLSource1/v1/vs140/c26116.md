# C26116
warning C26116: Failing to acquire or to hold lock \<lock> in \<func>.  
  
 Enforcement of syntactically scoped lock *acquire* and lock *release* pairs in C/C++ programs is not performed by the language. A function may introduce a locking side effect by making an observable modification to the concurrency state. For example, a lock wrapper function increments the number of lock acquisitions, or lock count, for a given lock.You can annotate a function that has a side effect from a lock acquire or lock release by using <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> or <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, respectively. Without such annotations, a function is expected not to change any lock count after it returns. If acquires and releases are not balanced, they are considered to be *orphaned*. Warning C26116 is issued when a function has been annotated with <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, but it does not acquire a lock, or when a function is annotated with <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> and releases the lock.  
  
## Example  
 The following example generates warning C26116 because the function <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> was annotated with <CodeContentPlaceHolder>6\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> but does not acquire it. The function <CodeContentPlaceHolder>7\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> generates the warning because it is annotated with <CodeContentPlaceHolder>8\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> and does not hold it.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
