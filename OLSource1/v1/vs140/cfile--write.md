# CFile::Write
Writes data from a buffer to the file associated with the `CFile` object.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      virtual void Write(  
   const void* lpBuf,  
   UINT nCount   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `lpBuf`  
 A pointer to the user-supplied buffer that contains the data to be written to the file.  
  
 `nCount`  
 The number of bytes to be transferred from the buffer. For text-mode files, carriage returnâ€“linefeed pairs are counted as single characters.  
  
## Remarks  
 **Write** throws an exception in response to several conditions, including the disk-full condition.  
  
## Example  
 [!code[NVC_MFCFiles#16](../vs140/codesnippet/CPP/cfile--write_1.cpp)]  
  
 In addition, see the examples for [CFile::CFile](../vs140/cfile--cfile.md) and [CFile::Open](../vs140/cfile--open.md).  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** afx.h
