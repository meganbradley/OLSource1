# Window Objects
MFC supplies class [CWnd](../vs140/cwnd-class.md) to encapsulate the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> handle of a window. The <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> object is a C++ window object, distinct from the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> that represents a Windows window but containing it. Use <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> to derive your own child window classes, or use one of the many MFC classes derived from <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>. Class <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> is the base class for all windows, including frame windows, dialog boxes, child windows, controls, and control bars such as toolbars. A good understanding of [the relationship between a C++ window object and an HWND](../vs140/relationship-between-a-c---window-object-and-an-hwnd.md) is crucial for effective programming with MFC.  
  
 MFC provides some default functionality and management of windows, but you can derive your own class from <CodeContentPlaceHolder>6\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> and use its member functions to customize the provided functionality. You can create child windows by constructing a <CodeContentPlaceHolder>7\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> object and calling its [Create](../vs140/cwnd--create.md) member function, then customize the child windows using <CodeContentPlaceHolder>8\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> member functions. You can embed objects derived from [CView](../vs140/cview-class.md), such as form views or tree views, in a frame window. And you can support multiple views of your documents via splitter panes, supplied by class [CSplitterWnd](../vs140/csplitterwnd-class.md).  
  
 Each object derived from class <CodeContentPlaceHolder>9\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> contains a message map, through which you can map Windows messages or command IDs to your own handlers.  
  
 The general literature on programming for Windows is a good resource for learning how to use the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>10\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> member functions, which encapsulate the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>11\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> APIs.  
  
## Functions for Operating On a CWnd  
 <CodeContentPlaceHolder>12\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> and its [derived window classes](../vs140/derived-window-classes.md) provide constructors, destructors, and member functions to initialize the object, create the underlying Windows structures, and access the encapsulated <CodeContentPlaceHolder>13\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>. <CodeContentPlaceHolder>14\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> also provides member functions that encapsulate Windows APIs for sending messages, accessing the window's state, converting coordinates, updating, scrolling, accessing the Clipboard, and many other tasks. Most Windows window-management APIs that take an <CodeContentPlaceHolder>15\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> argument are encapsulated as member functions of <CodeContentPlaceHolder>16\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>. The names of the functions and their parameters are preserved in the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>17\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> member function. For details about the Windows APIs encapsulated by <CodeContentPlaceHolder>18\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, see class [CWnd](../vs140/cwnd-class.md).  
  
## CWnd and Windows Messages  
 One of the primary purposes of <CodeContentPlaceHolder>19\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> is to provide an interface for handling Windows messages, such as <CodeContentPlaceHolder>20\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> or <CodeContentPlaceHolder>21\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>. Many of the member functions of <CodeContentPlaceHolder>22\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> are handlers for standard messages â€” those beginning with the identifier **afx_msg** and the prefix "On," such as <CodeContentPlaceHolder>23\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> and **OnMouseMove**. [Message Handling and Mapping](../vs140/message-handling-and-mapping.md) covers messages and message handling in detail. The information there applies equally to the framework's windows and those that you create yourself for special purposes.
