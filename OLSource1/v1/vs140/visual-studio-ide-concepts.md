# Visual Studio IDE Concepts
The topics in this section describe the overall structure of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] and the integrated development environment (IDE). Other topics explain VSPackages and services, and how to create and use them.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Visual Studio Environment Model](../vs140/visual-studio-extensibility-architecture.md)  
 Discusses the extensibility architecture, whose command-handling and routing scheme gives users an open framework to make easy access to both existing and installed command sets possible.  
  
 [Implementation Strategies](../vs140/implementation-strategies.md)  
 Describes the extension of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] by using add-ins or VSPackages, or a combination of both.  
  
 [Experimental Build](../vs140/the-experimental-instance.md)  
 Explains the experimental build of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]. When you develop an application that might change [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], the [!INCLUDE[vsipsdk](../vs140/includes/vsipsdk_md.md)] provides the experimental build for you to use instead of the released build.  
  
 [Visual Studio Shell](../vs140/visual-studio-shell.md)  
 Describes the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] IDE, which is the primary agent of integration in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].  
  
 [Visual Studio SDK and Automation](../Topic/Visual%20Studio%20SDK%20and%20Automation_deleted.md)  
 Discusses using automation, VSPackages, or a combination to create [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] extensibility applications.  
  
 [Visual Studio SDK and Managed Code](../vs140/visual-studio-sdk-and-managed-code.md)  
 Compares the different ways to write a VSPackage in managed code.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Visual Studio Integration Architecture](../vs140/vssdk-utilities.md)  
 Describes [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] and its IDE, and introduces strategies and techniques for extending the IDE.
