# The project &#39;project&#39; cannot be referenced. &lt;reason&gt;
A project-to-project reference to a particular project could not be made.  
  
 Referencing a project that builds an .exe file is the most common reason for this error. This error also indicates that a project references a project whose output is not an assembly (for example, a native C++ application).
