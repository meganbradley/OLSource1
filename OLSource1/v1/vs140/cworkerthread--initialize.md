# CWorkerThread::Initialize
Call this method to initialize the worker thread.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      HRESULT Initialize( ) throw( );Â   
HRESULT Initialize(  
   CWorkerThread< ThreadTraits > * pThread   
) throw( );  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `pThread`  
 An existing worker thread.  
  
## Return Value  
 Returns S_OK on success, or an error HRESULT on failure.  
  
## Remarks  
 This method should be called to initialize the object after creation or after a call to [CWorkerThread::Shutdown](../vs140/cworkerthread--shutdown.md).  
  
 To have two or more `CWorkerThread` objects use the same worker thread, initialize one of them without passing any arguments then pass a pointer to that object to the `Initialize` methods of the others. The objects initialized using the pointer should be shut down before the object used to initialize them.  
  
 See [CWorkerThread::Shutdown](../vs140/cworkerthread--shutdown.md) for information on how that method's behavior changes when initialized using a pointer to an existing object.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** atlutil.h
