# CWnd::OnSysKeyUp
If the `CWnd` object has the focus, the `OnSysKeyUp` member function is called by the framework when the user releases a key that was pressed while the ALT key was held down.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      afx_msg void OnSysKeyUp(  
   UINT nChar,  
   UINT nRepCnt,  
   UINT nFlags   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `nChar`  
 Specifies the virtual key code of the key being pressed. For a list of of standard virtual key codes, see Winuser.h  
  
 `nRepCnt`  
 Specifies the repeat count.  
  
 `nFlags`  
 Specifies the scan code, key-transition code, previous key state, and context code, as shown in the following list:  
  
|Value|Meaning|  
|-----------|-------------|  
|0–7|Scan code (OEM-dependent value). Low byte of high-order word.|  
|8|Extended key, such as a function key or a key on the numeric keypad (1 if it is an extended key; otherwise 0).|  
|9–10|Not used.|  
|11–12|Used internally by Windows.|  
|13|Context code (1 if the ALT key is held down while the key is pressed, 0 otherwise).|  
|14|Previous key state (1 if the key is down before the message is sent, 0 if the key is up).|  
|15|Transition state (1 if the key is being released, 0 if the key is being pressed).|  
  
 For `OnSysKeyUp` calls, the key-transition bit (bit 15) is 1. The context-code bit (bit 13) is 1 if the ALT key is down while the key is pressed; it is 0 if the message is sent to the active window because no window has the input focus.  
  
## Remarks  
 If no window currently has the input focus, the active window's `OnSysKeyUp` member function is called. The `CWnd` object that receives the call can distinguish between these two contexts by checking the context code in `nFlags`.  
  
 When the context code is 0, the `WM_SYSKEYUP` message received by `OnSysKeyUp` can be passed to the [TranslateAccelerator](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646373) Windows function, which will handle it as though it were a normal key message instead of a system-key message. This allows accelerator (shortcut) keys to be used with the active window even if the active window does not have the input focus.  
  
 For IBM Enhanced 101- and 102-key keyboards, enhanced keys are the right ALT and the right CTRL keys on the main section of the keyboard; the INS, DEL, HOME, END, PAGE UP, PAGE DOWN, and arrow keys in the clusters to the left of the numeric keypad; and the slash (/) and ENTER keys in the numeric keypad. Some other keyboards may support the extended-key bit in `nFlags`.  
  
 For non-U.S. Enhanced 102-key keyboards, the right ALT key is handled as the CTRL+ALT key combination. The following shows the sequence of messages and calls that result when the user presses and releases this key:  
  
|Sequence|Function Accessed|Message Passed|  
|--------------|-----------------------|--------------------|  
|1.|[WM_KEYDOWN](../vs140/cwnd--onkeydown.md)|**VK_CONTROL**|  
|2.|[WM_KEYDOWN](../vs140/cwnd--onkeydown.md)|**VK_MENU**|  
|3.|[WM_KEYUP](../vs140/cwnd--onkeyup.md)|**VK_CONTROL**|  
|4.|[WM_SYSKEYUP](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646287)|**VK_MENU**|  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.
