# How to: Combine and Compare String Collections (LINQ) (C#)
This example shows how to merge files that contain lines of text and then sort the results. Specifically, it shows how to perform a simple concatenation, a union, and an intersection on the two sets of text lines.  
  
### To set up the project and the text files  
  
1.  Copy these names into a text file that is named names1.txt and save it in your project folder:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
2.  Copy these names into a text file that is named names2.txt and save it in your project folder. Note that the two files have some names in common.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
## Example  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
## Compiling the Code  
 Create a project that targets the .NET Framework  version 3.5 or higher, with a reference to System.Core.dll and <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> directives for the System.Linq and System.IO namespaces.
