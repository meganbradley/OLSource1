# do (C# Reference)
The `do` statement executes a statement or a block of statements repeatedly until a specified expression evaluates to `false`. The body of the loop must be enclosed in braces, `{}`, unless it consists of a single statement. In that case, the braces are optional.  
  
## Example  
 In the following example, the `do-while` loop statements execute as long as the variable `x` is less than 5.  
  
 [!code[csrefKeywordsIteration#1](../vs140/codesnippet/CSharp/do--csharp-reference-_1.cs)]  
  
 Unlike the [while](../vs140/while--csharp-reference-.md) statement, a `do-while` loop is executed one time before the conditional expression is evaluated.  
  
 At any point in the `do-while` block, you can break out of the loop using the [break](../vs140/break--csharp-reference-.md) statement. You can step directly to the `while` expression evaluation statement by using the [continue](../vs140/continue--csharp-reference-.md) statement. If the `while` expression evaluates to true, execution continues at the first statement in the loop. If the expression evaluates to false, execution continues at the first statement after the `do-while` loop.  
  
 A `do-while` loop can also be exited by the [goto](../vs140/goto--csharp-reference-.md), [return](../vs140/return--csharp-reference-.md), or [throw](../vs140/throw--csharp-reference-.md) statements.
