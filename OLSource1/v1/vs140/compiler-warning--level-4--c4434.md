# Compiler Warning (level 4) C4434
a class constructor must have private accessibility; changing to private access  
  
 C4434 indicates that the compiler changed the accessibility of a static constructor. Static constructors must have private accessibility, as they are only meant to be called by the common language runtime. For more information, see [How to: Define Static Constructors in a Class or Struct](../vs140/how-to--define-and-consume-classes-and-structs--c---cli-.md#BKMK_Static_constructors).  
  
## Example  
 The following sample generates C4434.  
  
```  
// C4434.cpp  
// compile with: /W4 /c /clr  
public ref struct R {  
   static R(){}   // C4434  
};  
```
