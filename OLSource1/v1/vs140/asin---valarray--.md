# asin (&lt;valarray&gt;)
Operates on the elements of an input valarray, returning a valarray whose elements are equal to the arcsine of the elements of the input valarray.  
  
## Syntax  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
#### Parameters  
 <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 The input valarray whose elements are to be operated on by the member function.  
  
## Return Value  
 A valarray whose elements are equal to the arcsine of the elements of the input valarray.  
  
## Remarks  
 The units of the returned elements are in radians.  
  
 The return value is a principal value between +pi/2 and â€“pi/2 that is consistent with the sine value input.  
  
## Example  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 **The initial valarray is: -1 -0.75 -0.5 -0.25 0 0.25 0.5 0.75 1**  
**The arcsine of the initial valarray is:**  
 **-1.5708  radians, which is          -90  degrees**  
 **-0.848062  radians, which is     -48.5904  degrees**  
 **-0.523599  radians, which is          -30  degrees**  
 **-0.25268  radians, which is     -14.4775  degrees**  
 **0  radians, which is            0  degrees**  
 **0.25268  radians, which is      14.4775  degrees**  
 **0.523599  radians, which is           30  degrees**  
 **0.848062  radians, which is      48.5904  degrees**  
 **1.5708  radians, which is           90  degrees**
