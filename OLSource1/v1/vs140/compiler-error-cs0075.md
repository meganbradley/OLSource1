# Compiler Error CS0075
To cast a negative value, you must enclose the value in parentheses  
  
 If you are casting using a keyword that identifies a predefined type, then you do not need parentheses. Otherwise, you must put the parentheses because (x) â€“y will not be considered a cast expression. From the C# Specification, Section 7.6.6:  
  
 *From the disambiguation rule it follows that, if x and y are identifiers, (x)y, (x)(y), and (x)(-y) are cast-expressions, but (x)-y is not, even if x identifies a type. However, if x is a keyword that identifies a predefined type (such as int), then all four forms are cast-expressions (because such a keyword could not possibly be an expression by itself).*  
  
 The following code generates CS0075:
