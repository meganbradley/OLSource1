# Walkthroughs (MFC)
This section contains articles that walk you through various tasks associated with new MFC library features.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Walkthrough: Using the New MFC Shell Controls](../vs140/walkthrough--using-the-new-mfc-shell-controls.md)  
 In this walkthrough, you will create an application that resembles File Explorer. You will create a window that contains two panes. The left pane will contain a [CMFCShellTreeCtrl](../vs140/cmfcshelltreectrl-class.md) object that will display your Desktop in a hierarchical view. The right pane will contain a [CMFCShellListCtrl](../vs140/cmfcshelllistctrl-class.md) that will show the files in the folder that is selected in the left pane.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Putting Controls on Toolbars](../vs140/walkthrough--putting-controls-on-toolbars.md)
