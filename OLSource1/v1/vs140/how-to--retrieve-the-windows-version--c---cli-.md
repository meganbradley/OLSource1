# How to: Retrieve the Windows Version (C++-CLI)
The following code example demonstrates how to retrieve the platform and version information of the current operating system. This information is stored in the \<xref:System.Environment.OSVersion*?displayProperty=fullName> property and consists of an enumeration that describes the version of Windows in broad terms and a \<xref:System.Environment.Version*> object that contains the exact build of the operating system.  
  
## Example  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
