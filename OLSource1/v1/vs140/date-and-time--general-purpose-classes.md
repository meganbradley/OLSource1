# Date and Time: General-Purpose Classes
This article describes how to take advantage of the class library general-purpose services related to date and time management. Procedures described include:  
  
-   [Getting the current time](../vs140/current-time--general-purpose-classes.md)  
  
-   [Calculating elapsed time](../vs140/elapsed-time--general-purpose-classes.md)  
  
-   [Formatting a string representation of a date/time](../vs140/formatting-time-values--general-purpose-classes.md)  
  
 The <CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> class provides a way to represent date and time information easily. The <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> class represents elapsed time, such as the difference between two <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> objects.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  CTime objects can be used to represent dates between January 1, 1970, and January 18, 2038. <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> objects have a resolution of 1 second. <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> is based on the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> data type, defined in the *Run-Time Library Reference*.
