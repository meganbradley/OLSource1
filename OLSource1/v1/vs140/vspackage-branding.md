# VSPackage Branding
VSPackages can display icons and textual information about products (together called logos) in the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] splash screen and the **Help About** dialog box. For every product you add as a VSPackage, you can add one logo. The splash screen and **Help About** dialog box contain logos for the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] core products and other installed products.
