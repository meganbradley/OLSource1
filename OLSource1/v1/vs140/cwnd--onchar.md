# CWnd::OnChar
The framework calls this member function when a keystroke translates to a nonsystem character.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      afx_msg void OnChar(  
   UINT nChar,  
   UINT nRepCnt,  
   UINT nFlags   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `nChar`  
 Contains the character code value of the key.  
  
 `nRepCnt`  
 Contains the repeat count, the number of times the keystroke is repeated when user holds down the key.  
  
 `nFlags`  
 Contains the scan code, key-transition code, previous key state, and context code, as shown in the following list:  
  
|Value|Meaning|  
|-----------|-------------|  
|0-15|Specifies the repeat count. The value is the number of times the keystroke is repeated as a result of the user holding down the key.|  
|16-23|Specifies the scan code. The value depends on the original equipment manufacturer (OEM)|  
|24|Specifies whether the key is an extended key, such as the right-hand ALT and CTRL keys that appear on an enhanced 101- or 102-key keyboard. The value is 1 if it is an extended key; otherwise, it is 0.|  
|25-28|Used internally by Windows.|  
|29|Specifies the context code. The value is 1 if the ALT key is held down while the key is pressed; otherwise, the value is 0.|  
|30|Specifies the previous key state. The value is 1 if the key is down before the message is sent, or it is 0 if the key is up.|  
|31|Specifies the transition state. The value is 1 if the key is being released, or it is 0 if the key is being pressed.|  
  
## Remarks  
 This function is called before the [OnKeyUp](../vs140/cwnd--onkeyup.md) member function and after the [OnKeyDown](../vs140/cwnd--onkeydown.md) member function are called. `OnChar` contains the value of the keyboard key being pressed or released.  
  
 Because there is not necessarily a one-to-one correspondence between keys pressed and `OnChar` calls generated, the information in `nFlags` is generally not useful to applications. The information in `nFlags` applies only to the most recent call to the `OnKeyUp` member function or the `OnKeyDown` member function that precedes the call to `OnChar`.  
  
 For IBM Enhanced 101- and 102-key keyboards, enhanced keys are the right ALT and the right CTRL keys on the main section of the keyboard; the INS, DEL, HOME, END, PAGE UP, PAGE DOWN, and arrow keys in the clusters to the left of the numeric keypad; and the slash (/) and ENTER keys in the numeric keypad. Some other keyboards may support the extended-key bit in `nFlags`.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.
