# How to: Change the Appearance of a DataRepeater Control (Visual Studio)
You can change the appearance of a <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.DataRepeater*> control at design time by setting properties or at run time by handling the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.DataRepeater.DrawItem*> event.  
  
 Properties that you set at design time when the item template section of the control is selected will be repeated for each <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.DataRepeaterItem*> at run time. Appearance-related properties of the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.DataRepeater*> control itself will be visible at run time only if a part of the container is left uncovered (for example, if the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.Padding*> property is set to a large value).  
  
 At run time, appearance-related properties can be set based on conditions. For example, in a scheduling application, you might change the background color of an item to warn users when an item is past due. In the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.DataRepeater.DrawItem*> event handler, if you set a property in a conditional statement such as `Ifâ€¦Then`, you must also use an `Else` clause to specify the appearance when the condition is not met.  
  
### To change the appearance at design time  
  
1.  In the Windows Forms Designer, select the item template (upper) region of the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.DataRepeater*> control.  
  
2.  In the Properties window, select a property and change the value. Common properties that affect appearance include <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackColor*>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.BackgroundImage*>, <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Panel.BorderStyle*>, and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Control.ForeColor*>.  
  
### To change the appearance at run time  
  
1.  In the Code Editor, in the Event drop-down list, click **DrawItem**.  
  
2.  In the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.DataRepeater.DrawItem*> event handler, add code to set the properties:  
  
     [!code[VbPowerPacksDataRepeaterAppearance#1](../vs140/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to--change-the-appearance-of-a-datarepeater-control--visual-studio-_1.cs)]
[!code[VbPowerPacksDataRepeaterAppearance#1](../vs140/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to--change-the-appearance-of-a-datarepeater-control--visual-studio-_1.vb)]  
  
## Example  
 Some common customizations for the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.DataRepeater*> control include displaying the rows in alternating colors and changing the color of a field based on a condition. The following example shows how to perform these customizations. This example assumes that you have a <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.PowerPacks.DataRepeater*> control that is bound to the Products table in the Northwind database.  
  
 [!code[VbPowerPacksDataRepeaterAlternateBackColor#1](../vs140/codesnippet/VisualBasic/how-to--change-the-appearance-of-a-datarepeater-control--visual-studio-_2.vb)]
[!code[VbPowerPacksDataRepeaterAlternateBackColor#1](../vs140/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to--change-the-appearance-of-a-datarepeater-control--visual-studio-_2.cs)]  
  
 Note that for both of these customizations, you must provide code to set the properties for both sides of the condition. If you do not specify the `Else` condition, you will see unexpected results at run time.
