# How to: Overload Functions with Interior Pointers and Native Pointers (C++-CLI)
Functions can be overloaded depending on whether the parameter type is an interior pointer or a native pointer.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  This language feature is supported by the **/clr** compiler option, but not by the **/ZW** compiler option.  
  
## Example  
  
### Code  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
### Output  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
