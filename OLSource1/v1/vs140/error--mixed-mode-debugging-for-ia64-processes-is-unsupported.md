# Error: Mixed mode debugging for IA64 processes is unsupported
The [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] debugger does not support debugging mixed native and managed code in an Itanium-based process.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Build a 32-bit version of your application for debugging.
