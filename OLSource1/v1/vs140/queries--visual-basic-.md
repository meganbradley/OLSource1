# Queries (Visual Basic)
[!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] enables you to create [!INCLUDE[vbteclinqext](../vs140/includes/vbteclinqext_md.md)] expressions in your code.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Aggregate Clause](../vs140/aggregate-clause--visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> clause, which applies one or more aggregate functions to a collection.  
  
 [Distinct Clause](../vs140/distinct-clause--visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> clause, which restricts the values of the current range variable to eliminate duplicate values in query results.  
  
 [From Clause](../vs140/from-clause--visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> clause, which specifies a collection and a range variable for a query.  
  
 [Group By Clause](../vs140/group-by-clause--visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> clause, which groups the elements of a query result and can be used to apply aggregate functions to each group.  
  
 [Group Join Clause](../vs140/group-join-clause--visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> clause, which combines two collections into a single hierarchical collection.  
  
 [Join Clause](../vs140/join-clause--visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> clause, which combines two collections into a single collection.  
  
 [Let Clause (Visual Basic)](../vs140/let-clause--visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>6\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> clause, which computes a value and assigns it to a new variable in the query.  
  
 [Order By Clause](../vs140/order-by-clause--visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>7\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> clause, which specifies the sort order for columns in a query.  
  
 [Select Clause](../vs140/select-clause--visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>8\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> clause, which declares a set of range variables for a query.  
  
 [Skip Clause](../vs140/skip-clause--visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>9\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> clause, which bypasses a specified number of elements in a collection and then returns the remaining elements.  
  
 [Skip While Clause](../vs140/skip-while-clause--visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>10\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> clause, which bypasses elements in a collection as long as a specified condition is <CodeContentPlaceHolder>11\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> and then returns the remaining elements.  
  
 [Take Clause](../vs140/take-clause--visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>12\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> clause, which returns a specified number of contiguous elements from the start of a collection.  
  
 [Take While Clause](../vs140/take-while-clause--visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>13\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> clause, which includes elements in a collection as long as a specified condition is <CodeContentPlaceHolder>14\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> and bypasses the remaining elements.  
  
 [Where Clause](../vs140/where-clause--visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>15\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> clause, which specifies a filtering condition for a query.
