# ML Fatal Error A1007
**nesting level too deep**  
  
 The assembler reached its nesting limit. The limit is 20 levels except where noted otherwise.  
  
 One of the following was nested too deeply:  
  
-   A high-level directive such as [.IF](../vs140/.if.md), [.REPEAT](../vs140/.repeat.md), or [.WHILE](../vs140/.while.md).  
  
-   A structure definition.  
  
-   A conditional-assembly directive.  
  
-   A procedure definition.  
  
-   A [PUSHCONTEXT](../vs140/pushcontext.md) directive (the limit is 10).  
  
-   A segment definition.  
  
-   An include file.  
  
-   A macro.
