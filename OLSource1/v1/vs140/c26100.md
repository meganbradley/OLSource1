# C26100
warning C26100: Race condition. Variable \<var> should be protected by lock \<lock>.  
  
 The <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> annotation in the code specifies the lock to use to guard a shared variable. Warning C26100 is generated when the guard contract is violated.  
  
## Example  
 The following example generates warning C26100 because there is a violation of the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> contract.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 The contract violation occurs because an incorrect lock is used in the function <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>. In this case, <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> is the correct lock to use.  
  
## Example  
 Occasionally a shared variable only has to be guarded for write access but not for read access. In that case, use the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>6\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> annotation, as shown in the following example.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 This example also generates warning C26100 because it uses an incorrect lock in the function <CodeContentPlaceHolder>7\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>.
