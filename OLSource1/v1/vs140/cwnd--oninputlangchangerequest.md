# CWnd::OnInputLangChangeRequest
The framework calls this member for window with the focus when the user chooses a new input language.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
afx_msg void OnInputLangChangeRequest(  
    UINT nFlags,   
    UINT nLocaleId  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|[in] `nFlags`|A bitwise (OR) combination of flags that indicate the new locale was selected from the previous or next locale in the installed list of locales, or that the new input locale's keyboard layout can be used with the system character set.<br /><br /> The possible values are `INPUTLANGCHANGE_BACKWARD`, `INPUTLANGCHANGE_FORWARD`, and `INPUTLANGCHANGE_SYSCHARSET`.|  
|[in] `nLocaleId`|The input locale identifier. For more information, see [Language Identifier Constants and Strings](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd318693).|  
  
## Remarks  
 This method receives the [WM_INPUTLANGCHANGEREQUEST](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms632630) notification message, which is described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../vs140/includes/winsdk_md.md)]. This message is posted when the user chooses a new input language with either a hotkey that is specified in the keyboard control panel application, or from the indicator on the system taskbar.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.
