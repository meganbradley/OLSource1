# Checked Iterators
Checked iterators ensure that the bounds of your container are not overwritten.  
  
 Checked iterators apply to release builds and debug builds. For more information about how to use iterators when you compile in debug mode, see [Debug Iterator Support](../vs140/debug-iterator-support.md).  
  
## Remarks  
 For information about how to disable warnings that are generated by checked iterators, see [_SCL_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS](../vs140/_scl_secure_no_warnings.md).  
  
 You can use the following symbol with the checked iterators feature.  
  
 <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 If <CodeContentPlaceHolder>6\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> is defined as 1, unsafe use of iterators causes a runtime error and the program is terminated. If defined as 0, checked iterators are disabled. By default, the value for <CodeContentPlaceHolder>7\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> is 0 for release builds and 1 for debug builds.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Use <CodeContentPlaceHolder>8\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> to control [_SECURE_SCL](../vs140/_secure_scl.md). For more information, see [_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL](../vs140/_iterator_debug_level.md).  
  
 When <CodeContentPlaceHolder>9\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> is defined as 1, following SCL checks are performed:  
  
-   All standard iterators (for example, [vector::iterator](../vs140/vector--iterator.md)) are checked.  
  
-   If an output iterator is a checked iterator you will get checked behavior on calls to the standard function (for example, [std::copy](../vs140/copy.md)).  
  
-   If the output iterator is an unchecked iterator calls to the standard function will cause compiler warnings.  
  
-   The following functions will generate a runtime error if there is an access that is outside the bounds of the container:  
  
|||||  
|-|-|-|-|  
|[basic_string::operator&#91;&#93;](../vs140/basic_string--operator.md)|[bitset::operator&#91;&#93;](../vs140/bitset--operator.md)|[deque::back](../vs140/deque--back.md)|[deque::front](../vs140/deque--front.md)|  
|[deque::operator&#91;&#93;](../vs140/deque--operator.md)|[list::back](../vs140/list--back.md)|[list::front](../vs140/list--front.md)|[queue::back](../vs140/queue--back.md)|  
|[queue::front](../vs140/queue--front.md)|[vector::operator&#91;&#93;](../vs140/vector--operator.md)|[vector::back](../vs140/vector--back.md)|[vector::front](../vs140/vector--front.md)|  
  
 When <CodeContentPlaceHolder>10\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> is defined as 0:  
  
-   All standard iterators are unchecked (iterators can move beyond the container boundaries, which leads to undefined behavior).  
  
-   If an output iterator is a checked iterator you will get checked behavior on calls to the standard function (for example, <CodeContentPlaceHolder>11\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>).  
  
-   If an output iterator is an unchecked iterator you will get unchecked behavior on calls to the standard function (for example, <CodeContentPlaceHolder>12\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>).  
  
 A checked iterator refers to an iterator that will call <CodeContentPlaceHolder>13\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> if you attempt to move past the boundaries of the container. For more information about <CodeContentPlaceHolder>14\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, see [Parameter Validation](../vs140/parameter-validation.md).  
  
 [checked_array_iterator Class](../vs140/checked_array_iterator-class.md) and [unchecked_array_iterator Class](../vs140/unchecked_array_iterator-class.md) are the iterator adaptors that support checked iterators.  
  
## Example  
 When you compile by using <CodeContentPlaceHolder>15\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, a runtime error will occur if you attempt to access an element that is outside the bounds of the container by using the indexing operator of certain classes.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 This program will print out "67" then pop an assertion failure dialog box with additional information about the failure.  
  
## Example  
 Similarly, when you compile by using <CodeContentPlaceHolder>16\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, a runtime error will occur if you attempt to access an element by using front or back of certain classes, when the container is empty.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 This program will pop up an assertion failure dialog box with additional information about the failure.  
  
 The following code demonstrates various iterator use-case scenarios with comments about each.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
## Output  
 Compiling the code shown in the previous section with <CodeContentPlaceHolder>17\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> will result in the following compiler warning, but compiles without error into an executable:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 Running the console app executable results in the following output:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
