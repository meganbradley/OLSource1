# How to: Search for a Specific Work Item Using Microsoft Test Manager
You might want to search for a specific work item in your team project from [!INCLUDE[TCMext](../vs140/includes/tcmext_md.md)]. If you know the identifier for that work item, you can just open it without the requirement to open a specific activity.  
  
 **Requirements**  
  
-   Visual Studio Enterprise, [!INCLUDE[vstsTestEssLong](../vs140/includes/vststestesslong_md.md)]  
  
## Search for a Specific Work Item  
  
#### To search for a specific work item using Microsoft Test Manager  
  
1.  Open [!INCLUDE[TCMext](../vs140/includes/tcmext_md.md)].  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  To display the [!INCLUDE[TCMext](../vs140/includes/tcmext_md.md)] window, choose Start, All Programs, Microsoft Visual Studio, Microsoft Test Manager.  
  
2.  From any activity, press Ctrl-G.  
  
     The **Go to work item** dialog box is displayed.  
  
3.  Type the work item ID into **Work item ID**.  
  
4.  Choose **Open**.
