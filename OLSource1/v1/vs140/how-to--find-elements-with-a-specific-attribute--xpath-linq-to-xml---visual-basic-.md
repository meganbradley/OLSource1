# How to: Find Elements with a Specific Attribute (XPath-LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)
Sometimes you want to find all elements that have a specific attribute. You are not concerned about the contents of the attribute. Instead, you want to select based on the existence of the attribute.  
  
 The XPath expression is:  
  
 <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
  
## Example  
 The following code selects just the elements that have the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> attribute.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 This example produces the following output:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
