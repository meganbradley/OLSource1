# C6320
warning C6320: exception-filter expression is the constant EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER. This may mask exceptions that were not intended to be handled  
  
 This warning indicates the side effect of using EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER constant in __except block. In this case, the statement in the \__except block will always execute to handle the exception, including exceptions you did not want to handle in a particular function. It is recommended that you check the exception before handling it.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning because the __except block will try to handle exceptions of all types:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 To correct this warning, use <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> to check for a particular exception before handling it as shown in the following code:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
