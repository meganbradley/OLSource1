# How to: Sort or Filter Text Data by Any Word or Field (LINQ) (C#)
The following example shows how to sort lines of structured text, such as comma-separated values, by any field in the line. The field may be dynamically specified at runtime. Assume that the fields in scores.csv represent a student's ID number, followed by a series of four test scores.  
  
### To create a file that contains data  
  
1.  Copy the scores.csv data from the topic [How to: Join Content from Dissimilar Files (LINQ) (C#)](../vs140/how-to--join-content-from-dissimilar-files--linq---csharp-.md) and save it to your solution folder.  
  
## Example  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 This example also demonstrates how to return a query variable from a method.  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 Create a project that targets the .NET Framework  version 3.5 or higher, with a reference to System.Core.dll and <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> directives for the System.Linq and System.IO namespaces.
