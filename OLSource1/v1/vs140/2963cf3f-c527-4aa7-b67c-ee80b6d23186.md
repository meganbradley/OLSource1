# Expression has the type &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; which is a restricted type and cannot be used to access members inherited from &#39;Object&#39; or &#39;ValueType&#39;
An expression evaluates to a type that cannot be boxed by the common language runtime (CLR) but accesses a member that requires boxing.  
  
 *Boxing* refers to the processing necessary to convert a type to <CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> or, on occasion, to \<xref:System.ValueType*>. The common language runtime cannot box certain structure types, for example \<xref:System.ArgIterator*>, \<xref:System.RuntimeArgumentHandle*>, and \<xref:System.TypedReference*>.  
  
 This expression attempts to use the restricted type to call a method inherited from \<xref:System.Object*> or \<xref:System.ValueType*>, such as \<xref:System.Object.GetHashCode*> or \<xref:System.Object.ToString*>. To access this method, [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] has attempted an implicit boxing conversion that causes this error.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC31393  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Locate the expression that evaluates to the cited type.  
  
2.  Locate the part of your statement that attempts to call the method inherited from \<xref:System.Object*> or \<xref:System.ValueType*>.  
  
3.  Rewrite the statement to avoid the method call.
