# Creating Windows
The framework automatically creates most of the windows you need in a framework program. [Document/View Creation](../vs140/document-view-creation.md) shows how the framework creates the frame windows associated with documents and views. But for special purposes you can create your own windows — including your own child windows of frame windows or views — in addition to the windows supplied by the framework.
