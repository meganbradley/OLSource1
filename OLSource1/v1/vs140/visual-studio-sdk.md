# Visual Studio SDK
The Visual Studio SDK helps you extend Visual Studio features or integrate new features into Visual Studio. You can distribute your extensions to other users, as well as to the Visual Studio Gallery. The following are some of the ways in which you can extend Visual Studio:  
  
-   Add commands, buttons, menus, and other UI elements to the IDE  
  
-   Add tool windows for new functionality  
  
-   Extend IntelliSense for a given language, or provide IntelliSense for new programming languages  
  
-   Use light bulbs to provide hints and suggestions that help developers write better code  
  
-   Enable support for a new language  
  
-   Add a custom project type  
  
-   Reach millions of developers via the Visual Studio Gallery  
  
 If you’ve never written a Visual Studio extension before, you should find more information about these features and at [FAQ: Starting to Develop Visual Studio Extensions](../vs140/starting-to-develop-visual-studio-extensions.md).  
  
## Installing the Visual Studio SDK  
 Starting in Visual Studio 2015, you do not install the Visual Studio SDK from the download center. It is included as an optional feature in Visual Studio setup. You can also install the VS SDK later on. For more information, see [Installing the Visual Studio SDK](../vs140/installing-the-visual-studio-sdk.md).  
  
## What’s New in the Visual Studio 2015 SDK  
 The Visual Studio SDK has some new features, including light bulbs and new project items that allow you to create menu commands, tool windows, and editor extensions using a VSIX package. For more information, see [What's New in the Visual Studio 2015 SDK](../vs140/what-s-new-in-the-visual-studio-2015-sdk.md).  
  
## Visual Studio User Experience Guidelines  
 Get great tips for designing the UI for your extension in [Visual Studio User Experience Guidelines](../vs140/visual-studio-user-experience-guidelines.md).  
  
 You can also learn how to make your extension look great on high DPI devices with our [Addressing DPI Issues](../vs140/addressing-dpi-issues.md) topic.  
  
 Take advantage of the [Image Service and Catalog](../vs140/image-service-and-catalog.md) for great image management and support for high DPI and theming.  
  
## Finding and Installing Existing Visual Studio Extensions  
 You can find Visual Studio extensions in the **Extensions and Updates** dialog on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Managing Extensions and Updates](../vs140/finding-and-using-visual-studio-extensions.md). You can also find extensions in the [Visual Studio Gallery](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/)  
  
## Visual Studio SDK Reference  
 You can find the Visual Studio SDK API reference at [Reference for Visual Studio SDK](../vs140/visual-studio-sdk-reference.md).  
  
## Visual Studio SDK Samples  
 You can find open source examples of VS SDK extensions on GitHub at [Visual Studio Samples](https://aka.ms/vs2015sdksamples). This GitHub repo contains samples that illustrate various extensible features in Visual Studio.  
  
## Other Visual Studio SDK Resources  
 If you have questions about the VSSDK or want to share your experiences developing extensions, you can use the [Visual Studio Extensibility Forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/home?forum=vsx) or the [ExtendVS Group Chat](https://gitter.im/Microsoft/extendvs).  
  
 You can find more information in the [VSX Arcana blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vsx/) and an number of blogs written by Microsoft MVPs:
