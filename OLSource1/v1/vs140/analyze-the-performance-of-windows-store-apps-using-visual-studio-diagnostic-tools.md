# Analyze the performance of Windows Store apps using Visual Studio diagnostic tools
By showing you where the code of your Store app spends its time as your program executes, the Visual Studio profilers can help you find the performance bottlenecks in your apps, functions, and algorithms.  
  
## In This Section  
  
### Analyze CPU Usage  
 [Analyze CPU Usage in Store apps](../vs140/analyze-cpu-usage-in-a-windows-universal-app.md)  
  
 Starting with Visual Studio 2013 Update 2, the CPU Usage tool replaces the CPU Sampling tool.  
  
### Analyze HTML, CSS, and JavaScript performance  
 [Analyzing UI responsiveness (JavaScript)](../vs140/html-ui-responsiveness.md)  
  
### Analyze XAML, C#, Visual Basic, and C++ performance
