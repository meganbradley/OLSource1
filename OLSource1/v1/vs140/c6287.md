# C6287
warning C6287: redundant code: the left and right sub-expressions are identical  
  
 This warning indicates that a redundant element was detected in an expression.  
  
 It is difficult to judge the severity of this problem without examining the code. A duplicate test on its own is harmless, but the consequences of deleting the second test can be severe. The code should be inspected to ensure that a test was not omitted.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 The following code shows various methods to correct this warning:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
