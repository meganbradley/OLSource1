# How to: Write a Binary File (C++-CLI)
The following code example demonstrates writing binary data to a file. Two classes from the \<xref:System.IO*> namespace are used: \<xref:System.IO.FileStream*> and \<xref:System.IO.BinaryWriter*>. \<xref:System.IO.FileStream*> represents the actual file, while \<xref:System.IO.BinaryWriter*> provides an interface to the stream that allows binary access.  
  
 The following code example writes a file containing integers in binary format. This file can be read with the code in [How to: Read a Binary File](../vs140/how-to--read-a-binary-file--c---cli-.md).
