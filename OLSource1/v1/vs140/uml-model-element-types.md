# UML model element types
You can read and manipulate a UML model through a programming interface. This topic summarizes the hierarchy of element types. The hierarchy is the same as that defined in the UML specification.  
  
 The details of each type are provided in [API reference for Modeling Extensibility](../vs140/api-reference-for-uml-modeling-extensibility.md).  
  
## Element types  
 This is the set of types defined in the assembly <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>.  
  
 The fully qualified name of each item is "<CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>" followed by the name listed.  
  
 For convenience, this list is set out as an inheritance hierarchy. Where a type has more than one supertype, additional supertypes are listed after a colon (:).  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
