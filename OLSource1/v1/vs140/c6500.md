# C6500
warning C6500: invalid annotation: value for \<name> property is invalid  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This warning occurs only in code that is using a deprecated version of the source-code annotation language (SAL). We recommend that you port your code to use the latest version of SAL. For more information, see [Using SAL Annotations to Reduce C/C++ Code Defects](../vs140/using-sal-annotations-to-reduce-c-c---code-defects.md).  
  
 This warning indicates that a property value used in the annotation is not valid. For example, it can occur if an incorrect level of dereference is used in the Deref property, or if you use a constant value that is larger than size_t for properties like ElementSize.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning because an incorrect level of dereference is used in the Pre condition:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 To correct this warning, specify the correct level of dereference, as shown in the following sample code:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 This warning is generated for both Pre and Post conditions.
