# C6260
warning C6260: sizeof * sizeof is almost always wrong, did you intend to use a character count or a byte count?  
  
 This warning indicates that the results of two <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> operations have been multiplied together. The C/C++ <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> operator returns the number of bytes of storage an object uses. It is typically incorrect to multiply it by another <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> operation; usually one is interested in the number of bytes in an object or the number of elements in an array (for example the number of wide-characters in an array).  
  
 There is some unintuitive behavior associated with <CodeContentPlaceHolder>6\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> operator. For example, in C, the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>7\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> because  a character  is of an integral type. In C++, the type of a character literal is <CodeContentPlaceHolder>8\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, so <CodeContentPlaceHolder>9\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>. However, in both C and C++, the following is true:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 To correct this warning, use the following code:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
