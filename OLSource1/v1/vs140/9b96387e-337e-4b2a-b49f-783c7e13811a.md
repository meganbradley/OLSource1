# Class &#39;&lt;classname1&gt;&#39; must declare a &#39;Sub New&#39; because its base class &#39;&lt;classname2&gt;&#39; has more than one accessible &#39;Sub New&#39; that can be called with no arguments
A derived class does not declare a constructor, and [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] cannot generate one because it cannot determine which base class constructor to call.  
  
 When a derived class does not declare a constructor, [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] attempts to generate an implicit parameterless constructor that calls <CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>. If there is no accessible constructor in the base class that can be called without arguments, or if there is more than one, [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] cannot generate an implicit constructor.  
  
 This situation can arise, for example, if one base class constructor has a single <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> argument and another has a single <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> argument. Each of these can be called with no arguments.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC32036  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Declare and implement at least one <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> constructor somewhere in the derived class.  
  
2.  Add a call to a base class constructor, <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, as the first line of every <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>.
