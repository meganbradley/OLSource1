# C6239
warning C6239: (\<non-zero constant> && \<expression>) always evaluates to the result of \<expression>. Did you intend to use the bitwise-and operator?  
  
 This warning indicates that a non-zero constant value, other than one, was detected on the left side of a logical-AND operation that occurs in a test context. For example, the expression <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> is reduced to <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, which is the Boolean value of <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>.  
  
 This warning typically indicates an attempt to check a bit mask in which the bitwise-AND (<CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>) operator should be used, and is not generated if the non-zero constant evaluates to 1 because of its use for selectively choosing code paths.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 To correct this warning, use bitwise-AND (<CodeContentPlaceHolder>6\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>) operator as shown in the following code:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
