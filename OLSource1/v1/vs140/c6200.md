# C6200
warning C6200: index \<name> is out of valid index range \<min> to \<max> for non-stack buffer \<variable>  
  
 This warning indicates that an integer offset into the specified array exceeds the maximum bounds of that array. This defect might cause random behavior or crashes.  
  
 One common cause of this defect is using the size of an array as an index into the array. Because C/C++ array indexing is zero-based, the maximum legal index into an array is one less than the number of array elements.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning because the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> loop exceeds the index range:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 To correct both warnings, use correct array size as shown in the following code:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
