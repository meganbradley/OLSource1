# Visual Basic Language Walkthroughs
Walkthroughs give step-by-step instructions for common scenarios, which makes them a good place to start learning about the product or a particular feature area.  
  
 [Writing an Async Program](../vs140/walkthrough--accessing-the-web-by-using-async-and-await--csharp-and-visual-basic-.md)  
 Shows how to create an asynchronous solution by using [Async](../vs140/async--visual-basic-.md) and [Await](../vs140/await-operator--visual-basic-.md), which are introduced in [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../vs140/includes/vs_dev11_long_md.md)].  
  
 [Declaring and Raising Events](../vs140/walkthrough--declaring-and-raising-events--visual-basic-.md)  
 Illustrates how events are declared and raised in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)].  
  
 [Handling Events](../vs140/walkthrough--handling-events--visual-basic-.md)  
 Shows how to handle events using either the standard <CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> keyword or the new <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>/<CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> keywords.  
  
 [Creating and Implementing Interfaces](../vs140/walkthrough--creating-and-implementing-interfaces--visual-basic-.md)  
 Shows how interfaces are declared and implemented in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)].  
  
 [Defining Classes](../vs140/walkthrough--defining-classes--visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes how to declare a class and its fields, properties, methods, and events.  
  
 [Writing Queries in Visual Basic](../vs140/walkthrough--writing-queries-in-visual-basic.md)  
 Demonstrates how you can use Visual Basic language features to write [!INCLUDE[vbteclinqext](../vs140/includes/vbteclinqext_md.md)] query expressions.  
  
 [Implementing IEnumerable(Of T) in Visual Basic](../vs140/walkthrough--implementing-ienumerable-of-t--in-visual-basic.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create a class that implements the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> interface and a class that implements the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> interface to read a text file one line at a time.  
  
 [Calling Windows APIs](../vs140/walkthrough--calling-windows-apis--visual-basic-.md)  
 Explains how to use <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> statements and call Windows APIs. Includes information about using attributes to control marshaling for the API call and how to expose an API call as a method of a class.  
  
 [Creating COM Objects with Visual Basic](../vs140/walkthrough--creating-com-objects-with-visual-basic.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create COM objects in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)], both with and without the COM class template.  
  
 [Implementing Inheritance with COM Objects](../vs140/walkthrough--implementing-inheritance-with-com-objects--visual-basic-.md)  
 Demonstrates how to use [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] 6.0 to create a COM object containing a class, and then use it as a base class in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)].  
  
 [Multithreading](../vs140/walkthrough--multithreading-with-the-backgroundworker-component--csharp-and-visual-basic-.md)  
 Shows how to create a multithreaded application that searches a text file for occurrences of a word.  
  
 [Determining Where My.Application.Log Writes Information](../vs140/walkthrough--determining-where-my.application.log-writes-information--visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes the default <CodeContentPlaceHolder>6\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> settings and how to determine the settings for your application.  
  
 [Changing Where My.Application.Log Writes Information](../vs140/walkthrough--changing-where-my.application.log-writes-information--visual-basic-.md)  
 Shows how to override the default <CodeContentPlaceHolder>7\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> and <CodeContentPlaceHolder>8\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> settings for logging event information and cause the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>9\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> object to write to other log listeners.  
  
 [Filtering My.Application.Log Output](../vs140/walkthrough--filtering-my.application.log-output--visual-basic-.md)  
 Demonstrates how to change the default log filtering for the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>10\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> object.  
  
 [Creating Custom Log Listeners](../vs140/walkthrough--creating-custom-log-listeners--visual-basic-.md)  
 Demonstrates how to create a custom log listener and configure it to listen to the output of the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>11\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> object.  
  
 [Embedding Types from Managed Assemblies](../vs140/walkthrough--embedding-types-from-managed-assemblies--csharp-and-visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes how to create an assembly and a client program that embeds types from it.  
  
 [Validating That Passwords Are Complex (Visual Basic)](../vs140/walkthrough--validating-that-passwords-are-complex--visual-basic-.md)  
 Demonstrates how to check for strong-password characteristics and update a string parameter with information about which checks a password fails.  
  
 [Encrypting and Decrypting Strings in Visual Basic](../vs140/walkthrough--encrypting-and-decrypting-strings-in-visual-basic.md)  
 Shows how to use the \<xref:System.Security.Cryptography.DESCryptoServiceProvider*> class to encrypt and decrypt strings.  
  
 [Manipulating Files and Folders in Visual Basic](../vs140/walkthrough--manipulating-files-and-directories-in-visual-basic.md)
