# How to: Query An Assembly&#39;s Metadata with Reflection (LINQ) (Visual Basic)
The following example shows how LINQ can be used with reflection to retrieve specific metadata about methods that match a specified search criterion. In this case, the query will find the names of all the methods in the assembly that return enumerable types such as arrays.  
  
## Example  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 The example uses the \<xref:System.Reflection.Assembly.GetTypes*> method to return an array of types in the specified assembly. The [Where Clause (Visual Basic)](../vs140/where-clause--visual-basic-.md) filter is applied so that only public types are returned. For each public type, a subquery is generated by using the \<xref:System.Reflection.MethodInfo*> array that is returned from the \<xref:System.Type.GetMethods*> call. These results are filtered to return only those methods whose return type is an array or else a type that implements <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>Imports` statement for the System.Linq namespace.
