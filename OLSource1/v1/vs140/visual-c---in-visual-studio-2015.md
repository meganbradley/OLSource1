# Visual C++ in Visual Studio 2015
The [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../vs140/includes/vcprvc_md.md)] programming language and development tools help you develop native Universal Windows apps, native desktop and server applications, cross-platform libraries that run on Android and iOS as well as Windows, and managed apps that run on the .NET Framework.  
  
 **Who is this documentation for?**  
  
 This content is for C++ developers who are writing programs.  
  
-   If you are looking for a C++ redistributable package and runtime components so that you can run a program, go to the [Microsoft Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/) and enter **Visual C++** in the search box.  
  
-   If you are looking for an introduction to C++ programming concepts, go to one of the many websites that offer this content, or get a copy of [Programming -- Principles and Practice Using C++ (Second Edition)](http://stroustrup.com/Programming/) by the inventor of C++, Bjarne Stroustrup. The Visual C++ content assumes you already have a basic familiarity with C++.  
  
-   If you are looking for the Visual C++ compiler, you need to download a paid or free edition of Visual Studio 2015 from [https://www.visualstudio.com/](https://www.visualstudio.com/).  
  
> [!WARNING]
>  In Visual Studio 2015, Visual C++ is not installed by default. When installing, be sure to choose **Custom** installation and then choose the C++ components you require. Or, if Visual Studio is already installed, choose **File &#124; New &#124; Project &#124; C++** and you will be prompted to install the necessary components.
