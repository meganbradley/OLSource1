   // Header File: HELPIDS.H
   //
   // This example header file is #include'd twice:
   // (1) It is #include'd by the .CPP file that passes the DWORD
   //     context i.d. to CWinApp::WinHelp.
   // (2) It is #include'd in the [MAP] section of the .HPJ file,
   //     to associate the help context string "HID_MYTOPIC" with
   //     the help context numeric i.d., 101.
   // The help context string "HID_MYTOPIC" is what identifies the
   // help topic in the help .RTF source file, in the "#" footnote:
   //     # HID_MYTOPIC
   //
   // Note, it is not necessary to manage help context id's this way
   // for help topics associated with command id's and user interface
   // id's defined in your RESOURCE.H file; you should use the MAKEHM
   // tool via the custom build rule on your resource.h file to produce 
   // a help map (.HM) file for these id's.  It is necessary to manage 
   // help context id's as illustrated here only for help topics not 
   // associated with command id's or user interface id's. 

   #define HID_MYTOPIC 101
  
   // Show the custom help topic that has the context string
   // "HID_MYTOPIC" in the help .RTF file, and which is mapped
   // to the DWORD i.d. HID_MYTOPIC in the above HELPIDS.H file.
   AfxGetApp()->WinHelp(HID_MYTOPIC);


   // The following is one line of code in the help map (.HM)
   // file produced by the MAKEHM tool, which is called by the custom
   // build rule on the resource.h file.  The MAKEHM tool reads the 
   // following #define in the application's RESOURCE.H file:
   #define ID_MYCOMMAND 0x08004
   // and adds a help id offset value of 0x10000 to create the
   // help context DWORD value 0x18004:
   // HID_MYCOMMAND                           0x18004
   // See MFC Tech Note 28 for more information on help id offset values.

   // Rarely will you need to directly call WinHelp yourself
   // with the help context i.d. for a command or user interface
   // object. The framework will call WinHelp automatically when
   // the user, for example, hits F1 when the focus is on a
   // My Command menu item. However, if you do want to directly
   // call WinHelp for the help topic associated with the command,
   // here is how you would do it:

   AfxGetApp()->WinHelp(0x10000 + ID_MYCOMMAND);
