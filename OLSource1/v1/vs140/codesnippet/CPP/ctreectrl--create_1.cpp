   // Assuming your window has a CTreeCtrl member named m_TreeCtrl,
   // you can create the tree control window with a child ID of ID_MYTREE
   // using a call like this:

   m_TreeCtrl.Create(WS_VISIBLE | WS_TABSTOP | WS_CHILD | WS_BORDER
      | TVS_HASBUTTONS | TVS_LINESATROOT | TVS_HASLINES
      | TVS_DISABLEDRAGDROP | TVS_NOTOOLTIPS | TVS_EDITLABELS,
      CRect(10, 10, 300, 100), this, ID_MYTREE);

   // The control will have the appropiate window styles, and the tree
   // control styles specified are those most commonly used.
