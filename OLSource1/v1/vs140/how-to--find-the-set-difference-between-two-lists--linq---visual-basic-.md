# How to: Find the Set Difference Between Two Lists (LINQ) (Visual Basic)
This example shows how to use LINQ to compare two lists of strings and output those lines that are in names1.txt but not in names2.txt.  
  
### To create the data files  
  
1.  Copy names1.txt and names2.txt to your solution folder as shown in [How to: Combine and Compare String Collections (LINQ) (Visual Basic)](../vs140/how-to--combine-and-compare-string-collections--linq---visual-basic-.md).  
  
## Example  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 Some types of query operations in Visual Basic, such as \<xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Except*>, \<xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Distinct*>, \<xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Union*>, and \<xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Concat*>, can only be expressed in method-based syntax.  
  
## Compiling the Code  
 Create a project that targets the .NET Framework version 3.5 or higher with a reference to System.Core.dll and a <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> statement for the System.Linq namespace.
