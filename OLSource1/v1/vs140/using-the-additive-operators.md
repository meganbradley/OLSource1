# Using the Additive Operators
The following examples, which illustrate the addition and subtraction operators, use these declarations:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 These statements are equivalent:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 The value of <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> is multiplied by the length of a **float** and added to <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>. The resulting pointer value is the address of <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 In this example, the address of the third element of <CodeContentPlaceHolder>6\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> (given by <CodeContentPlaceHolder>7\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>) is subtracted from the address of the fifth element of <CodeContentPlaceHolder>8\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> (given by <CodeContentPlaceHolder>9\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>). The difference is divided by the length of a **float**; the result is the integer value 2.
