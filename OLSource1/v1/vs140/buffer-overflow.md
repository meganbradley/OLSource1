# Buffer Overflow
Varying character sizes can cause problems when you put characters into a buffer. Consider the following code, which copies characters from a string, <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, into a buffer, <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 The question is: Was the last byte copied a lead byte? The following does not solve the problem because it can potentially overflow the buffer:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 The <CodeContentPlaceHolder>6\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> call attempts to do the correct thing â€” copy the full character, whether it is 1 or 2 bytes. But it does not take into account that the last character copied might not fit the buffer if the character is 2 bytes wide. The correct solution is:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 This code tests for possible buffer overflow in the loop test, using <CodeContentPlaceHolder>7\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> to test the size of the current character pointed to by <CodeContentPlaceHolder>8\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>. By making a call to the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>9\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> function, you can replace the code in the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>10\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> loop with a single line of code. For example:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
