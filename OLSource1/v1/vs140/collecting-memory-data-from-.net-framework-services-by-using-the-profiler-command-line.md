# Collecting Memory Data from .NET Framework Services by Using the Profiler Command Line
This section describes the procedures and options for collecting memory allocation and object lifetime data for a [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../vs140/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] service using the sampling method from the command line.
