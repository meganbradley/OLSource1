# DFX_Text
Transfers `CString` data between the field data members of a [CDaoRecordset](../vs140/cdaorecordset-class.md) object and columns of a record on the data source.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      void AFXAPI DFX_Text(  
   CDaoFieldExchange* pFX,  
   LPCTSTR szName,  
   CString& value,  
   int nPreAllocSize = AFX_DAO_TEXT_DEFAULT_SIZE,  
   DWORD dwBindOptions = AFX_DAO_ENABLE_FIELD_CACHE   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `pFX`  
 A pointer to an object of class [CDaoFieldExchange](../vs140/cdaofieldexchange-class.md). This object contains information to define the context for each call of the function.  
  
 `szName`  
 The name of a data column.  
  
 *value*  
 The value stored in the indicated data member â€” the value to be transferred. For a transfer from recordset to data source, the value, of type [CString](../vs140/cstringt-class.md), is taken from the specified data member. For a transfer from data source to recordset, the value is stored in the specified data member.  
  
 `nPreAllocSize`  
 The framework preallocates this amount of memory. If your data is larger, the framework will allocated more space as needed. For better performance, set this size to a value large enough to prevent reallocations.  
  
 `dwBindOptions`  
 An option that lets you take advantage of MFC's double buffering mechanism for detecting recordset fields that have changed. The default, `AFX_DAO_ENABLE_FIELD_CACHE`, uses double buffering. The other possible value is `AFX_DAO_DISABLE_FIELD_CACHE`. If you specify this value, MFC does no checking on this field. You must call [SetFieldDirty](../vs140/cdaorecordset--setfielddirty.md) and [SetFieldNull](../vs140/cdaorecordset--setfieldnull.md) yourself.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can control whether data is double buffered by default by setting [CDaoRecordset::m_bCheckCacheForDirtyFields](../vs140/cdaorecordset--m_bcheckcachefordirtyfields.md).  
  
## Remarks  
 Data is mapped between type **DAO_CHAR** in DAO (or, if the symbol **_UNICODE** is defined, **DAO_WCHAR**) and type [CString](../vs140/cstringt-class.md) in the recordset.  
  
## Example  
 This example shows several calls to `DFX_Text`. Notice also the two calls to [CDaoFieldExchange::SetFieldType](../vs140/cdaofieldexchange--setfieldtype.md). You must write the first call to `SetFieldType` and its **DFX** call. The second call and its associated **DFX** calls are normally written by the code wizard that generated the class.
