# The type for variable &#39;&lt;variablename&gt;&#39; will not be inferred because it is bound to a field in an enclosing scope
The type for variable '\<variablename>' will not be inferred because it is bound to a field in an enclosing scope. Either change the name of '\<variablename>', or use the fully qualified name (for example, 'Me.variablename' or 'MyBase.variablename').  
  
 A loop control variable in your code has the same name as a field of the class or other enclosing scope. Because the control variable is used without an <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> clause, it is bound to the field in the enclosing scope, and the compiler does not create a new variable for it or infer its type.  
  
 In the following example, <CodeContentPlaceHolder>6\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, the control variable in the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>7\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> statement, is bound to the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>8\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> field in the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>9\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> class. The compiler does not create a new variable for the control variable <CodeContentPlaceHolder>10\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> or infer its type.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 By default, this message is a warning. For information about how to hide warnings or how to treat warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](../vs140/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic.md).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC42110  
  
### To address this warning  
  
-   Make the loop control variable local by changing its name to an identifier that is not also the name of a field of the class.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
-   Clarify that the loop control variable binds to the class field by prefixing <CodeContentPlaceHolder>11\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> to the variable name.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
-   Instead of relying on local type inference, use an <CodeContentPlaceHolder>12\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> clause to specify a type for the loop control variable.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
## Example  
 The following code shows the earlier example with the first correction in place.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
