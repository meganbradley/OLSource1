# How to: Retrieve File Information (C++-CLI)
The following code example demonstrates the \<xref:System.IO.FileInfo*> class. When you have the name of a file, you can use this class to retrieve information about the file such as the file size, directory, full name, and date and time of creation and of the last modification.  
  
 This code retrieves file information for Notepad.exe.
