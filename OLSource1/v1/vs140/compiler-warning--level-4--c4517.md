# Compiler Warning (level 4) C4517
access-declarations are deprecated; member using-declarations provide a better alternative  
  
 The ANSI C++ committee has declared access declarations (changing the access of a member in a derived class without the [using](../vs140/using-declaration.md) keyword) to be outdated. Access declarations may not be supported by future versions of C++.
