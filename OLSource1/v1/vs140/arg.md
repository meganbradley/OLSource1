# arg
Extracts the argument from a complex number.  
  
## Syntax  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
#### Parameters  
 <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 The complex number whose argument is to be determined.  
  
## Return Value  
 The argument of the complex number.  
  
## Remarks  
 The argument is the angle that the complex vector makes with the positive real axis in the complex plane. For a complex number *a + bi*, the argument is equal to arctan(*b/a*)*.* The angle has a positive sense when measured in a counterclockwise direction from the positive real axis and a negative sense when measured in a clockwise direction. The principal values are greater than â€“pi and less than or equal to +pi.  
  
## Example  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 **c1 = polar ( 5.0 ) = (5,0)**  
**c2 = polar ( 5.0 , pi / 6 ) = (4.33013,2.5)**  
**c3 = polar ( 5.0 , 13 \* pi / 6 ) = (4.33013,2.5)**  
**The modulus of c1 is recovered from c1 using: abs ( c1 ) = 5**  
**Argument of c1 is recovered from c1 using:**  
 **arg ( c1 ) = 0 radians, which is 0 degrees.**  
**The modulus of c2 is recovered from c2 using: abs ( c2 ) = 5**  
**Argument of c2 is recovered from c2 using:**  
 **arg ( c2 ) = 0.523599 radians, which is 30 degrees.**  
**The complex numbers c2 & c3 have the same principal arguments.**   
## Requirements  
 **Header:** \<complex>  
  
 **Namespace:** std
