# Elementary Data Types (Visual Basic)
[!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] supplies a set of predefined data types, which you can use for many of your programming elements. This section describes these types and how to use them.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Every elementary data type in Visual Basic is supported by a structure or a class that is in the \<xref:System*> namespace. The compiler uses each data type keyword as an alias for the underlying structure or class. For example, declaring a variable by using the reserved word <CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> is the same as declaring it by using the fully qualified structure name \<xref:System.Byte*?displayProperty=fullName>.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Numeric Data Types](../vs140/numeric-data-types--visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes the integral and non-integral numeric types.  
  
 [Character Data Types](../vs140/character-data-types--visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> and <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> types.  
  
 [Miscellaneous Data Types](../vs140/miscellaneous-data-types--visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, and <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> types.
