# Library Support for Multithreading
All versions of the CRT now support multi threading with the exception of the non-locking versions of some functions. See [Multithreaded Libraries Performance](../vs140/multithreaded-libraries-performance.md) for more information.  
  
 See [C Run-Time Libraries](../vs140/crt-library-features.md) for more information on CRT versions.
