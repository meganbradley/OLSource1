# File Access with Visual Basic
The <CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> object provides tools for working with files and folders. Its properties, methods, and events allow you to create, copy, move, investigate, and delete files and folders. <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> provides better performance than the legacy functions (<CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, <CodeContentPlaceHolder>6\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, etc.) that are provided by [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] for backward compatibility.
