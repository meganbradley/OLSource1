# What Is AtlAxWin100?
`AtlAxWin100` is the name of a window class that helps provide ATL's control-hosting functionality. When you create an instance of this class, the window procedure will automatically use the control-hosting API to create a host object associated with the window and load it with the control that you specify as the title of the window.
