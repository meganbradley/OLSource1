# Cannot refer to an instance member of a class from within a shared method or shared member initializer without an explicit instance of the class
You have tried to refer to a non-shared member of a class from within a shared procedure. The following example demonstrates such a situation.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 In the preceding example, the assignment statement <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> generates this error message. This is because a shared procedure is attempting to access an instance variable.  
  
 The variable <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> is an instance member because it is not declared as [Shared](../vs140/shared--visual-basic-.md). Each instance of class <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> contains its own individual variable <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>. When one instance sets or changes the value of <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, it does not affect the value of <CodeContentPlaceHolder>6\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> in any other instance.  
  
 However, the procedure <CodeContentPlaceHolder>7\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> is <CodeContentPlaceHolder>8\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> among all instances of class <CodeContentPlaceHolder>9\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>. This means it is not associated with any one instance of the class, but rather operates independently of individual instances. Because it has no connection with a particular instance, <CodeContentPlaceHolder>10\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> cannot access an instance variable. It must operate only on <CodeContentPlaceHolder>11\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> variables. When <CodeContentPlaceHolder>12\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> sets or changes the value of a shared variable, that new value is available to all instances of the class.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30369  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Decide whether you want the member to be shared among all instances of the class, or kept individual for each instance.  
  
2.  If you want a single copy of the member to be shared among all instances, add the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>13\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> keyword to the member declaration. Retain the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>14\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> keyword in the procedure declaration.  
  
3.  If you want each instance to have its own individual copy of the member, do not specify <CodeContentPlaceHolder>15\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> for the member declaration. Remove the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>16\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> keyword from the procedure declaration.
