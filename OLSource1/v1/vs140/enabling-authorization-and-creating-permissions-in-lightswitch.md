# Enabling Authorization and Creating Permissions in LightSwitch
You can use the authorization and authentication features in LightSwitch to control access to screens and data. For example, you could create a permission to view a payroll screen, and the application administrator can grant or deny that permission to individuals or to groups of users defined as *roles*.  
  
 In this set of lessons you will learn how to enable authentication and create permissions.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  These lessons build upon the My First Application project that you last modified in the [Setting the Startup Screen for a LightSwitch Application](../vs140/setting-the-startup-screen-for-a-lightswitch-application.md) lesson. If your application isn't already open in Visual Studio, on the menu bar, choose **File**, **Open Project** to open it.
