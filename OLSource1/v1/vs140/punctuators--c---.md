# Punctuators (C++)
Punctuators in C++ have syntactic and semantic meaning to the compiler but do not, of themselves, specify an operation that yields a value. Some punctuators, either alone or in combination, can also be C++ operators or be significant to the preprocessor.  
  
 Any of the following characters are considered punctuators:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 The punctuators **[ ]**, **( )**, and **{ }** must appear in pairs after [translation phase](../vs140/phases-of-translation.md) 4.
