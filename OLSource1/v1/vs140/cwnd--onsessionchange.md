# CWnd::OnSessionChange
The framework calls this member function to notify an application of a change in session state.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
afx_msg void OnSessionChange(  
    UINT nSessionState,   
    UINT nId  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|[in] `nSessionState`|A status code describes the session state change.|  
|[in] `nId`|A session identifier.|  
  
## Remarks  
 This method receives the [WM_WTSSESSION_CHANGE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa383828) notification, which is described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../vs140/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  
  
 The `nSessionState` parameter specifies that a session is connected or disconnected from the console or a remote terminal, a user logged on or off, a session is locked or unlocked, or a session has changed to remote-controlled status. For more information, see the `wParam` parameter of the the [WM_WTSSESSION_CHANGE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa383828) message.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** afxwin.h
