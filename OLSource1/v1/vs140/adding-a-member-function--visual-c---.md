# Adding a Member Function (Visual C++)
In **Class View**, you can add a member function to any class. When you do this, a declaration is added to the header file, and a stub member-function body is added to the class's implementation file, which you can then modify.  
  
### To add a member function to a class  
  
1.  In **Class View**, expand the project node to display the classes in the project. (To open **Class View**, on the menu bar, choose **View**, **Class View**.)  
  
2.  Open the shortcut menu for the class you want to add a member function to, and then choose **Add**, **Add Function**.  
  
3.  Provide the appropriate details about the member function. For more information, see [Add Member Function Wizard](../vs140/add-member-function-wizard.md).  
  
4.  Choose the **Finish** button to generate the member function code.
