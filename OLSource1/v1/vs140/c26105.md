# C26105
warning C26105: Lock order violation. Acquiring lock \<lock> with level \<level> causes order inversion.  
  
 Concurrency SAL supports *lock levels*. To declare a lock level, which is denoted by a string literal without double quotes, use <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>. You can impose an order of acquisition between two lock levels by using the annotation <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, which states that locks that have level <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> must be acquired before locks that have level <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>. To establish a lock order hierarchy (a partial order among lock levels), use multiple <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> annotations. To associate a lock with a lock level, use the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>6\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> annotation when you declare the lock. Warning C26105 is issued when a lock ordering violation is detected.  
  
## Example  
 The following example generates warning C26105 because there is a lock order inversion in the function <CodeContentPlaceHolder>7\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
