# How Can I Keep Focus When Stepping Through My Program?
## Description  
 My program has a window-activation problem. Stepping through the program with the debugger interferes with my ability to reproduce the problem because my program keeps losing focus. Is there any way to avoid this?  
  
## Solution  
 If you have a second computer, use remote debugging. You can operate your program on the remote computer while you run the debugger on the host. For more information, see [How to: Select a Remote Computer](assetId:///4332ba8e-2f0b-4f62-b96a-e762b9f3c3ba).
