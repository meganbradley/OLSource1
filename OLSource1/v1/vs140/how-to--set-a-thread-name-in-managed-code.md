# How to: Set a Thread Name in Managed Code
Thread naming is possible in any edition of Visual Studio. Thread naming is useful for keeping track of threads in the **Threads** window. Because the **Threads** window is not available in the Visual Studio Express editions, thread naming has little utility in Express editions.  
  
 To set a thread name in managed code, use the \<xref:System.Threading.Thread.Name*> property.  
  
## Example  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
