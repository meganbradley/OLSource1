# How to: Generate Text Files from XML (Visual Basic)
This example shows how to generate a comma-separated values (CSV) file from an XML file.  
  
## Example  
 The [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] version uses procedural code to aggregate the collection of strings into a single string.  
  
 This example uses the following XML document: [Sample XML File: Customers and Orders (LINQ to XML)](../vs140/sample-xml-file--customers-and-orders--linq-to-xml-1.md).  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 This code produces the following output:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
