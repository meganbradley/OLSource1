# Collecting Concurrency Data for a Service by Using the Profiler Command Line
The concurrency method of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Profiling Tools enables you to collect resource contention data and thread activity data that shows you CPU utilization, thread contention, thread migration, synchronization delays, areas of overlapped IO, and other system events.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Enhanced security features in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 required significant changes in the way the Visual Studio profiler collects data on these platforms. Windows Store apps also require new collection techniques. See [Profiling Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 applications](../vs140/performance-tools-on-windows-8-and-windows-server-2012-applications.md).
