# __assume
**Microsoft Specific**  
  
 Passes a hint to the optimizer.  
  
## Syntax  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
#### Parameters  
 <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 Any expression that is assumed to evaluate to true.  
  
## Remarks  
 The optimizer assumes that the condition represented by <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> is true at the point where the keyword appears and remains true until <CodeContentPlaceHolder>6\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> is modified (for example, by assignment to a variable). Selective use of hints passed to the optimizer by <CodeContentPlaceHolder>7\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> can improve optimization.  
  
 If the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>8\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> statement is written as a contradiction (an expression that always evaluates to false), it is always treated as <CodeContentPlaceHolder>9\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>. If your code isnâ€™t behaving as expected, ensure that the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>10\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> you defined is valid and true, as described earlier. For more information about expected <CodeContentPlaceHolder>11\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> behavior, see the later remarks.  
  
> [!WARNING]
>  A program must not contain an invalid <CodeContentPlaceHolder>12\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> statement on a reachable path. If the compiler can reach an invalid <CodeContentPlaceHolder>13\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> statement, the program might cause unpredictable and potentially dangerous behavior.  
  
 <CodeContentPlaceHolder>14\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> is not a genuine intrinsic. It does not have to be declared as a function and it cannot be used in a <CodeContentPlaceHolder>15\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> directive. Although no code is generated, the code generated by the optimizer is affected.  
  
 Use <CodeContentPlaceHolder>16\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> in an [ASSERT](../vs140/_assert--_asserte--_assert_expr-macros.md) only when the assert is not recoverable. Do not use <CodeContentPlaceHolder>17\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> in an assert for which you have subsequent error recovery code because the compiler might optimize away the error-handling code.  
  
 The <CodeContentPlaceHolder>18\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> statement is a special case. Use <CodeContentPlaceHolder>19\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> to indicate a code path that cannot be reached. The following example shows how to use <CodeContentPlaceHolder>20\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> to indicate that the default case of a switch statement cannot be reached. This shows the most typical use of <CodeContentPlaceHolder>21\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>.  
  
## Requirements  
  
|Intrinsic|Architecture|  
|---------------|------------------|  
|<CodeContentPlaceHolder>22\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>|x86, ARM, [!INCLUDE[vcprx64](../vs140/includes/vcprx64_md.md)]|  
  
## Example  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 The use of <CodeContentPlaceHolder>23\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> tells the optimizer that the default case cannot be reached. The example demonstrates that the programmer knows that the only possible inputs for <CodeContentPlaceHolder>24\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> will be 1 or 2. If another value is passed in for <CodeContentPlaceHolder>25\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, the program becomes invalid and causes unpredictable behavior.  
  
 As a result of the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>26\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> statement, the compiler does not generate code to test whether <CodeContentPlaceHolder>27\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> has a value that is not represented in a case statement. For this to work, the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>28\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> statement must be the first statement in the body of the default case.  
  
 Because the compiler generates code based on <CodeContentPlaceHolder>29\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, that code might not run correctly if the expression inside the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>30\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> statement is false at run time. If you are not sure that the expression will always be true at run time, you can use the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>31\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> function to protect the code.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 Unfortunately, this use of <CodeContentPlaceHolder>32\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> prevents the compiler from performing the default-case optimization that was described earlier in this document. As an alternative, you can use a separate macro, as follows.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
