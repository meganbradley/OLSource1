# CWnd::OnMouseLeave
The framework calls this member function when the cursor leaves the client area of the window specified in a prior call to [TrackMouseEvent](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646265).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
afx_msg void OnMouseLeave();  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 This method receives the [WM_MOUSELEAVE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms645615) notification, which is described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../vs140/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** afxwin.h  
  
 This method is supported in [!INCLUDE[windowsver](../vs140/includes/windowsver_md.md)] and later.
