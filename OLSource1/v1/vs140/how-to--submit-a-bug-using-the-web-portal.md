# How to: Submit a bug using the web portal
You can submit a bug using the web portal at any time during the software development process. For example, you perform ad hoc testing and find a bug, or you notice incorrect behavior while youâ€™re discussing the application under test with your team mates. You can manually attach information to this bug and link it to other work items.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Using the web portal to submit a bug does not automatically add data that was collected when a test was run, unlike when you create a bug using Test Runner or the Exploratory Testing window from Microsoft Test Manager. For more information about these methods, see [Submitting Bugs](../vs140/submitting-bugs-in-microsoft-test-manager.md).  
  
### To connect to the web portal  
  
1.  Open a browser window and type a URL that uses the following form, where *ServerName* is the name of the application tier for Team Foundation Server, and the default *Port* is **8080**:  
  
     **http://** *ServerName:Port* **/tfs/**  
  
     For example, to connect to the server named **FabrikamPrime**, you would type **http://FabrikamPrime:8080/tfs/**. For more information, see [Connect to and Access Team Projects in Team Foundation Server](assetId:///1372e56c-b34f-42c2-b72c-94b57620c75c).  
  
2.  In the **Windows Identity** dialog box, enter your credentials and choose the **OK** button.  
  
3.  On the server home page, choose a team project link from those displayed, or choose **Browse all** to choose a team project from all those hosted on the server.  
  
     The **HOME** page for the selected team project displays.
