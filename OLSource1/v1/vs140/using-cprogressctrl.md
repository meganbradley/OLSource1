# Using CProgressCtrl
You can use the progress control to indicate the progress of a lengthy operation. It is a rectangle that is gradually filled with the system highlight color as the operation progresses.  
  
 The progress control is represented in MFC by class [CProgressCtrl](../vs140/cprogressctrl-class.md).  
  
 When you initially create the progress control, you specify its size and position, parent window (usually a dialog box), and ID. By using the `dwStyle` parameter, you can also specify various window styles for the control and styles for how it fills.
