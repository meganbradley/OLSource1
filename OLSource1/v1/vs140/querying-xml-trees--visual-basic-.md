# Querying XML Trees (Visual Basic)
This section provides examples of [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../vs140/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)] queries.  
  
 For more information about writing [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../vs140/includes/vbteclinq_md.md)] queries, see [Getting Started with LINQ in Visual Basic](../vs140/getting-started-with-linq-in-visual-basic.md).  
  
 After you have instantiated an XML tree, writing queries is the most effective way to extract data from the tree. Also, querying combined with functional construction enables you to generate a new XML document that has a different shape from the original document.
