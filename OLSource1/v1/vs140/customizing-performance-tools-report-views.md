# Customizing Performance Tools Report Views
This section covers how to customize reports that are generated with [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Profiling Tools.  
  
## Common Tasks  
  
|Task|Related Content|  
|----------|---------------------|  
|**Add, remove, and sort by columns in a report view:** You can specify the columns that you want to display in table-based views, and you can specify the order in which the columns appear. You can also sort the rows of the report table by the column values.|-   [How to: Customize Performance Report View Columns](../vs140/how-to--customize-report-view-columns.md)|  
|**Eliminate small functions from the report:** You can eliminate functions that are smaller than a specified threshold from reports.|-   [How to: Configure Noise Reduction in Performance Reports](../vs140/how-to--configure-noise-reduction-in-report-views.md)|  
|**Filter the date in a report view**: You can limit the data that appear in a report to a time segment of the profiling run. You can specify a time segment in the timeline graph of the Summary View, or you can specify the time segment in a query that you define in the report view filter. You can also filter the reports to show only functions that are defined in your code files.|-   [Filtering Performance Reports](../vs140/filtering-report-views.md)<br />-   [How to: Filter Profiling Reports from the Summary Timeline](../vs140/how-to--filter-report-views-from-the-summary-timeline.md)<br />-   [How to: Filter Reports to View Just My Code](../vs140/how-to--filter-profiling-tools-report-views-to-display-just-my-code.md)<br />-   [Profiler Report View Filter](../vs140/performance-report-view-filter.md)|
