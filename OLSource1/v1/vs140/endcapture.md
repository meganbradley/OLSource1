# EndCapture
Ends a capture interval that was started with <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>.  
  
## Syntax  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
## Remarks  
 A capture interval typically spans a subset of one frame, such as when you want to capture graphics information only about a certain kind of draw call. If the capture interval spans a call to present, then two frames of graphics information are captured. The first frame spans the interval between the call to <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> and the call to present; the second frame spans the interval between the first Direct3D event after the call to present and the call to <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>.  
  
 To capture an interval, you must prepare your app to capture and record graphics informationâ€”that is, you must have called [Init](../vs140/init.md) through an instance of the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> class before you call <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> or <CodeContentPlaceHolder>6\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>.
