# Create, manage, and run unit tests, coded UI tests, web performance tests, and load tests
Create, manage, and run unit tests, coded UI tests, web performance tests, and load tests with Visual Studio Enterprise.  
  
 Unit tests and coded UI tests are generally used by developers, or by team members who use Visual Studio, to validate the quality of their code in an app. For example, you might run these tests prior to checking your code into [version control](assetId:///33267cee-fe5f-4aa3-b2cd-6d22ceace314). See [Unit Test Your Code](../vs140/unit-test-your-code.md) and [Use UI Automation To Test Your Code](../vs140/use-ui-automation-to-test-your-code.md). However, team members involved in testing the application can also use these tests types for converting manual tests to automated tests and for isolating bugs that come out of integration testing from [Team Foundation builds](assetId:///a971b0f9-7c28-479d-a37b-8fd7e27ef692).

|**Create tests in Visual Studio:** Create unit, coded UI, web performance and load tests. If needed, you can also create generic tests to call external programs and tests. Additionally, you can create ordered tests that contain these test types.|-   [Creating Automated System Tests Using Visual Studio](../vs140/creating-automated-tests-using-visual-studio.md)|  
|**Running tests in Visual Studio:** There are several ways to run your automated tests. If you just want to run your automated tests locally or use a test controller and test agents, you can do that from Visual Studio.<br /><br /> Unit tests and coded UI tests are run using the Test Explorer, whereas web performance tests and load tests are run from their Visual Studio editors.|-   [Running Automated System Tests Using Microsoft Visual Studio](../vs140/running-automated-tests-using-microsoft-visual-studio.md)|  
|**Performance and stress testing:** Visual Studio provides specific test facilities for performance and stress testing. An app can be instrumented and driven to measure its performance under specified loads. Web apps can be driven with multiple requests, simulating many users.|-   [Testing Performance and Stress Using Web Performance and Load Tests](../vs140/web-performance-and-load-tests-in-visual-studio.md)|  
|**Submitting bugs in Visual Studio:** You can submit a bug using Visual Studio at any time during the software development process. For example, you perform ad hoc testing and find a bug, or you notice incorrect behavior while youâ€™re discussing the app under test with your team mates. You can manually attach information to this bug and link it to other work items.|-   [How to: Submit a Bug Using Microsoft Visual Studio](../vs140/how-to--submit-a-bug-using-microsoft-visual-studio.md)|
