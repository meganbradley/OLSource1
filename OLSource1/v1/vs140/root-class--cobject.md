# Root Class: CObject
Most of the classes in the Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library are derived from a single base class at the root of the class hierarchy. `CObject` provides a number of useful capabilities to all classes derived from it, with very low overhead. For more information about `CObject` and its capabilities, see [Using CObject](../vs140/using-cobject.md).  
  
 [CObject](../vs140/cobject-class.md)  
 The ultimate base class of most MFC classes. Supports serializing data and obtaining run-time information about a class.  
  
 [CRuntimeClass](../vs140/cruntimeclass-structure.md)  
 Structure used to determine the exact class of an object at run time.
