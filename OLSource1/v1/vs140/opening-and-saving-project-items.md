# Opening and Saving Project Items
When you add a new project type, you must manage the opening and saving of your projects files in the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE). The following topics discuss the different approaches to opening and saving files.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Displaying Files by Using the Open File Command](../vs140/displaying-files-by-using-the-open-file-command.md)  
 Provides a step-by-step explanation of how the IDE handles the **Open File** command and the role of projects in responding to this command.  
  
 [Displaying Files by Using the Open With Command](../vs140/displaying-files-by-using-the-open-with-command.md)  
 Provides a detailed, step-by-step explanation of how the IDE handles the **Open With** command, prompting the opening of a file that has some choice of standard editors.  
  
 [How to: Open Project-Specific Editors](../vs140/how-to--open-project-specific-editors.md)  
 Provides step-by-step instructions for specifying that files of a particular type in your project should be opened by using a project-specific editor.  
  
 [How to: Open Standard Editors](../vs140/how-to--open-standard-editors.md)  
 Provides step-by-step instructions for specifying how to enable the IDE to open a standard editor for files in your project type.

 Provides a detailed explanation of how the IDE handles the **Save**, **Save As**, and **Save All** commands for a document opened in a standard editor.  
  
 [Saving a Custom Document](../vs140/saving-a-custom-document.md)  
 Provides a diagram and detailed explanation of how the IDE handles the **Save**, **Save As**, and **Save All** commands for documents opened in a custom editor.  
  
 [Determining Which Editor Opens a File in a Project](../vs140/determining-which-editor-opens-a-file-in-a-project.md)  
 Discusses the process that the IDE follows to select the appropriate editor or designer for a file.  
  
## Related Sections

 Lists the four types of editors that the IDE can host and gives descriptions of each editor.
