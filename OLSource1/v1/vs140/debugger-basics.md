# Debugger Basics
The Visual Studio debugger allows you to observe the run-time behavior of your program and locate logic errors. The debugger works with all Visual Studio programming languages and their associated libraries. With the debugger, you can break execution to step through your code and evaluate variables in your application.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Getting Started with the Debugger](../vs140/getting-started-with-the-debugger.md)  
 Explains how to use the debugger to control the execution of your application.  
  
 [Navigating through Code with the Debugger](../vs140/navigating-through-code-with-the-debugger.md)  
 Describes how to step through code with the debugger.  
  
 [Using Breakpoints](../vs140/using-breakpoints.md)  
 Describes what breakpoints are and how to use them.  
  
 [Debugger Windows](../vs140/debugger-windows.md)  
 Lists the different debugger windows.  
  
 [Just My Code](../vs140/just-my-code.md)  
 Describes the Just My Code feature that lets you step over system, framework, and other non-user calls and that collapses those calls in call stack displays.  
  
 [Exception Handling](../vs140/managing-exceptions-with-the-debugger.md)  
 Describes exceptions, how the debugger handles them and how to change that handling, how to see where the exception occurred and see the variable contents, limitations for unhandled exceptions in managed code, and fixing exceptions in native (C++) code.  
  
 [Attach to Running Processes with the Visual Studio Debugger](../vs140/attach-to-running-processes-with-the-visual-studio-debugger.md)  
 Explains how to attach to a process that is already running.  
  
 [Specify Symbol (.pdb) and Source Files in the Visual Studio Debugger](../vs140/specify-symbol--.pdb--and-source-files-in-the-visual-studio-debugger.md)  
 Explains how to specify symbol and source files for debugging.  
  
 [Debug 64-Bit Applications](../vs140/debug-64-bit-applications.md)  
 Explains how to debug 64-bit applications, and how to troubleshoot problems.  
  
 [Debugger Security](../vs140/debugger-security.md)  
 Describes security practices for the debugger.
