# OnCmdMsg Handler
To accomplish the routing of commands, each command target calls the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> member function of the next command target in the sequence. Command targets use <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> to determine whether they can handle a command and to route it to another command target if they cannot handle it.  
  
 Each command-target class may override the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> member function. The overrides let each class route commands to a particular next target. A frame window, for example, always routes commands to its current child window or view, as shown in the table [Standard Command Route](../vs140/command-routing.md).  
  
 The default <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> implementation of <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> uses the message map of the command-target class to search for a handler function for each command message it receives â€” in the same way that standard messages are searched. If it finds a match, it calls the handler. Message-map searching is explained in [How the Framework Searches Message Maps](../vs140/how-the-framework-searches-message-maps.md).
