# How to: Display URLs as Links in the Editor
You can choose to have the Code Editor treat Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) in your code as active links. When you use this feature, URLs:  
  
-   Appear underlined.  
  
-   Display a **ToolTip** when you hover over them.  
  
-   Attempt to open the Web site indicated when you **CTRL** + left-click on the link. By default, the Web site is displayed in the internal Web browser.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Customizing Development Settings in Visual Studio](assetId:///22c4debb-4e31-47a8-8f19-16f328d7dcd3).  
  
## Procedure  
  
#### To display URLs as links  
  
1.  On the **Tools** menu, click **Options**.  
  
2.  Click **Text Editor**.  
  
3.  To change the option for only one language, expand the folder for that language and choose **General**.  
  
     —or—  
  
     To change the option for all languages, expand the **All Languages** folder and choose **General**.  
  
4.  Under **Display**, select **Enable single-click URL navigation**.
