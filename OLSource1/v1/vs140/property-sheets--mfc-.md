# Property Sheets (MFC)
This family of articles explains how to implement support for property sheets in MFC applications. A property sheet, also known as a tab dialog box, provides a way to manage large numbers of controls in a dialog box. The property sheet contains property pages, each based on a separate dialog template resource. You can divide your dialog box's controls into logical groups and put each group on its own property page.
