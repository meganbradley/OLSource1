# Cannot convert anonymous type to expression tree because it contains a field that is used in the initialization of another field
The compiler does not accept conversion of an anonymous to an expression tree when one property of the anonymous type is used to initialize another property of the anonymous type. For example, in the following code, <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> is declared in the initialization list and then used as the initial value for <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 **Error ID:** BC36548  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Assign the initial value for <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> to a local variable. Assign that variable to both <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> and <CodeContentPlaceHolder>6\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, as shown in the following code.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
