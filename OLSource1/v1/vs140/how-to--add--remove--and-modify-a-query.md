# How to: Add, Remove, and Modify a Query
A query provides information to screens in your application. A query can also provide information to any custom business logic that you add to the application. You can add, remove or modify queries. For more information, see [Queries: Retrieving Information from a Data Source](../vs140/queries--retrieving-information-from-a-data-source.md).  
  
### To add a query  
  
1.  In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **Data Sources** node, expand the desired data source node, and then double-click an entity or table (For example: **Contact**).  
  
2.  The data designer opens.  
  
3.  On the **Command Bar** of the **Data Designer**, click **Query**.  
  
     A node that represents the query is added to **Solution Explorer** and the query opens in the **Query Designer**.  
  
### To remove a query  
  
1.  In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **Data Sources** node, expand the desired data source node, and then expand the appropriate entity or table (For example: **Contact**).  
  
2.  Right-click the query that you want to remove, and then click **Delete**.  
  
### To modify a query  
  
1.  In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **Data Sources** node, expand the desired data source node, and then expand the appropriate entity or table (For example: **Contact**).  
  
     Queries appear beneath the node that you expand.  
  
2.  Perform either of the following tasks to modify the query:  
  
    -   To rename a query, right-click the query, and then click **Rename**.  
  
    -   To change the contents of a query, double-click the query.  
  
     The query opens in the **Query Designer**.
