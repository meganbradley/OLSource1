# How to: Invoke a Delegate Method (Visual Basic)
This example shows how to associate a method with a delegate and then invoke that method through the delegate.  
  
### Create the delegate and matching procedures  
  
1.  Create a delegate named <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
2.  Declare a class that contains a method with the same signature as the delegate.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
3.  Define a method that creates an instance of the delegate and invokes the method associated with the delegate by calling the built-in <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> method.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
