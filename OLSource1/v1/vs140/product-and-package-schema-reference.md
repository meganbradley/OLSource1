# Product and Package Schema Reference
A *product file* is an XML manifest that describes all of the external dependencies required by a [!INCLUDE[ndptecclick](../vs140/includes/ndptecclick_md.md)] application. Examples of external dependencies include the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../vs140/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] and the Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC). A package file is similar to a product file but is used to install the culture-dependent components of a dependency, such as localized assemblies, license agreements, and documentation.  
  
 The product and packages file consists of either a top-level <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> or <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> element, each of which contains the following elements.  
  
|Element|Description|Attributes|  
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|  
|[\<Product> Element (ClickOnce Bootstrapper)](../vs140/-product--element--bootstrapper-.md)|Required top-level element for product files.|None|  
|[\<Package> Element (ClickOnce Bootstrapper)](../vs140/-package--element--bootstrapper-.md)|Required top-level element for package files.|<CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>\<br />\<br /> <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>\<br />\<br /> <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>|  
|[\<RelatedProducts> Element (ClickOnce Bootstrapper)](../vs140/-relatedproducts--element--bootstrapper-.md)|Optional element for product files. The other products that this product either installs or depends upon.|None|  
|[\<InstallChecks> Element (ClickOnce BootStrapper)](../vs140/-installchecks--element--bootstrapper-.md)|Required element. Lists the dependency checks to perform on the local computer during installation.|None|  
|[\<Commands> Element (ClickOnce Bootstrapper)](../vs140/-commands--element--bootstrapper-.md)|Required element.  Executes one or more installation checks as described by <CodeContentPlaceHolder>6\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, and denotes which package to install should the check fail.|None|  
|[\<PackageFiles> Element (ClickOnce Bootstrapper)](../vs140/-packagefiles--element--bootstrapper-.md)|Required element. Lists the packages that might be installed by this installation process.|None|  
|[\<Strings> Element (ClickOnce Bootstrapper)](../vs140/-strings--element--bootstrapper-.md)|Required element. Stores localized versions of the product name and error strings.|None|  
  
## Remarks  
 The package schema is consumed by Setup.exe, a stub program generated by the MS Build bootstrapping task that contains little hard-coded logic of its own. The schema drives every aspect of the installation process.  
  
 <CodeContentPlaceHolder>7\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> the tests that setup.exe should perform for the existence of a given package. <CodeContentPlaceHolder>8\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> lists all of the packages that the setup process might have to install, should a given test fail. Each Command entry under Commands executes one of the tests described by <CodeContentPlaceHolder>9\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, and specifies which <CodeContentPlaceHolder>10\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> to run should the test fail. You can use the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>11\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> element to localize product names and error messages, so that you can use one single installation binary to install your application for any number of languages.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example demonstrates a complete product file for installing the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../vs140/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)].  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
