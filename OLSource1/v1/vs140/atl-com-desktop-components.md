# ATL COM Desktop Components
The ATL Reference documents the Active Template Library (ATL), a set of template-based C++ classes that simplify the programming of Component Object Model (COM) objects. To fully take advantage of ATL, a working familiarity with COM is highly recommended.  
  
## In This Section  
 [ATL Class Overview](../vs140/atl-class-overview.md)  
 Provides links to and brief descriptions of the ATL classes organized by category.  
  
 [ATL Classes](../vs140/atl-classes.md)  
 Provides reference material on the classes organized alphabetically.  
  
 [ATL Functions](../vs140/atl-functions.md)  
 Provides reference material on the global functions organized alphabetically. Includes topics organizing the functions into categories.  
  
 [ATL Global Variables](../vs140/atl-global-variables.md)  
 Provides reference material on the global variables organized alphabetically.  
  
 [ATL Macros](../vs140/atl-macros.md)
