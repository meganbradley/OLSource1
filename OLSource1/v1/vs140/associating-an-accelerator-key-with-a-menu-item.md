# Associating an Accelerator Key with a Menu Item
Many times, you want a menu item and a keyboard combination to issue the same program command. You do this by assigning the same resource identifier (ID) to the menu item and to an entry in your application's accelerator table. You then edit the menu item's caption to show the name of the accelerator. For more information on menu items and accelerator keys, see [Associating a Menu Item with an Accelerator Key](../vs140/associating-a-menu-command-with-an-accelerator-key.md).  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](assetId:///8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](assetId:///bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).
