The following topics first examine how the framework routes commands, then examine how other messages and control notifications are sent to windows:  
  
-   [Message sending and receiving](../vs140/message-sending-and-receiving.md)  
  
-   [How noncommand messages reach their handlers](../vs140/how-noncommand-messages-reach-their-handlers.md)  
  
-   [Command routing](../vs140/command-routing.md)  
  
-   [Command Routing Illustration](../vs140/command-routing-illustration.md)  
  
-   [The OnCmdMsg Handler](../vs140/oncmdmsg-handler.md)
