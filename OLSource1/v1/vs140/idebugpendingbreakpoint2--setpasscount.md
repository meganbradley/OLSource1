# IDebugPendingBreakpoint2::SetPassCount
Sets or changes the pass count associated with the pending breakpoint.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```cpp#  
HRESULT SetPassCount(   
   BP_PASSCOUNT bpPassCount  
);  
```  
  
```c#  
int SetPassCount(   
   BP_PASSCOUNT bpPassCount  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `bpPassCount`  
 [in] A [BP_PASSCOUNT](../vs140/bp_passcount.md) structure that contains the pass count.  
  
## Return Value  
 If successful, returns `S_OK`; otherwise, returns an error code. Returns `E_BP_DELETED` if the breakpoint has been deleted.  
  
## Remarks  
 Any pass count that was previously associated with the pending breakpoint is lost. All breakpoints bound from this pending breakpoint are called to set their pass count to the `bpPassCount` parameter.
