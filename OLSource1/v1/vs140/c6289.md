# C6289
warning C6289: Incorrect operator: mutual exclusion over &#124;&#124; is always a non-zero constant. Did you intend to use && instead?  
  
 This warning indicates that in a test expression a variable is being tested against two different constants and the result depends on either condition being true. This always evaluates to true.  
  
 This problem is generally caused by using <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> in place of <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, but can also be caused by using <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> where <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> was intended.  
  
## Example  
 The following code generates this warning:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 To correct this warning, use the following code:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
