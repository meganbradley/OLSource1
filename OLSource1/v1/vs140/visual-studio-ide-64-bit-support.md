# Visual Studio IDE 64-Bit Support
[!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] enables you to set up your applications to target different platforms, including 64-bit platforms. For more information on 64-bit platform support in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], see [64-bit Applications](assetId:///fd4026bc-2c3d-4b27-86dc-ec5e96018181).
