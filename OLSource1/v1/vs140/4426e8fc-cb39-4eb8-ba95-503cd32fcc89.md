# First statement of this &#39;Sub New&#39; must be a call to &#39;MyBase.New&#39; or &#39;MyClass.New&#39; (No Accessible Constructor Without Parameters)
First statement of this 'Sub New' must be a call to 'MyBase.New' or 'MyClass.New' because base class '\<basename>' of '\<derivedname>' does not have an accessible 'Sub New' that can be called with no arguments.  
  
 In a derived class, every constructor must call a base class constructor (<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>). If the base class has a constructor with no parameters that is accessible to derived classes, <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> can be called automatically. If not, a base class constructor must be called with parameters, and this cannot be done automatically. In this case, the first statement of every derived class constructor must call a parameterized constructor on the base class, or call another constructor in the derived class that makes a base class constructor call.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30148  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Either call <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> supplying the required parameters, or call a peer constructor that makes such a call.  
  
     For example, if the base class has a constructor thatâ€™s declared as <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, the first statement in the derived class constructor might be <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>.
