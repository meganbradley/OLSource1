# Command-Line Switches (Visual Studio SDK)
Devenv.exe, the executable that starts the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE), supports command-line switches specifically for development of VSPackages. VSPackages can also make their own switches available at the Devenv command line. The following topics provide information about how to use command-line switches in the IDE.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Devenv Command-Line Switches for VSPackage Development](../vs140/devenv-command-line-switches-for-vspackage-development.md)  
 Describes the Devenv command-line switches you can use to simplify VSPackage development, debugging, and deployment.  
  
 [Adding Command-Line Switches](../vs140/adding-command-line-switches.md)  
 Describes how to implement, look for, and read user-entered command-line switches for your package.
