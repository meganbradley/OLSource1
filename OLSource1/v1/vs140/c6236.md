# C6236
warning C6236: (\<expression> &#124;&#124; \<non-zero constant>) is always a non-zero constant  
  
 This warning indicates that a non-zero constant value, other than one, was detected on the right side of a logical OR operation that occurs in a test context. Logically, this implies that the test is redundant and can be removed safely. Alternatively, it suggests that the programmer may have intended to use a different operator, for example, the equality (<CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>), bitwise-AND (<CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>) or bitwise-XOR (<CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>) operator, to test for a specific value or flag.  
  
 This warning is not generated for the common idiom when the non-zero constant is 1, because of its use for selectively enabling code paths at compile time. However, the warning is generated if the non-zero constant is formed by an expression that evaluates to 1, for example, 1 + 0.  
  
## Example  
 This code shows how warning C6236 can appear. Because <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> is not 0, the expression <CodeContentPlaceHolder>6\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> is always non-zero, and the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>7\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> clause is never executed. However, <CodeContentPlaceHolder>8\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> is a constant with a value other than one, which suggests that it is meant as a value for comparison:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 The following code instead uses a bitwise-AND (<CodeContentPlaceHolder>9\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>) operator to test whether the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>10\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> bit of the input parameter <CodeContentPlaceHolder>11\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> is set:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
