# How to: Configure Visual C++ Projects to Target 64-Bit Platforms
You can use the project configurations in Visual Studio to set up C++ applications to target 64-bit platforms. You can also migrate Win32 project settings into a 64-bit project configuration.  
  
### To set up C++ applications to target 64-bit platforms  
  
1.  Open the C++ project that you want to configure.  
  
2.  Open the property pages for that project. For more information, see [How to: Open Project Property Pages](../vs140/how-to--open-project-property-pages.md).  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  For .NET projects, make sure that the **Configuration Properties** node, or one of its child nodes, is selected in the **\<Projectname> Property Pages** dialog box; otherwise, the **Configuration Manager** button remains unavailable.  
  
3.  Choose the **Configuration Manager** button to open the **Configuration Manager** dialog box.  
  
4.  In the **Active Solution Platform** drop-down list, select the **\<Newâ€¦>** option to open the **New Solution Platform** dialog box.  
  
5.  In the **Type or select the new platform** drop-down list, select a 64-bit platform.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  In the **New Solution Platform** dialog box, you can use the **Copy settings from** option to copy existing project settings into the new 64-bit project configuration.  
  
6.  Choose the **OK** button. The platform that you selected in the preceding step appears under **Active Solution Platform** in the **Configuration Manager** dialog box.  
  
7.  Choose the **Close** button in the **Configuration Manager** dialog box, and then choose the **OK** button in the **\<Projectname> Property Pages** dialog box.  
  
### To copy Win32 project settings into a 64-bit project configuration  
  
-   When the **New Solution Platform** dialog box is open while you set up a project to target a 64-bit platform, in the **Copy settings from** drop-down list, select **Win32**. These project settings are automatically updated on the project level:  
  
    -   The [/MACHINE](../vs140/-machine--specify-target-platform-.md) linker option is set to **/MACHINE:X64**.  
  
    -   **Register Output** is turned OFF. For more information, see [Linker Property Pages](../vs140/linker-property-pages.md).  
  
    -   **Target Environment** is set to **/env x64**. For more information, see [MIDL Property Pages: General](../vs140/midl-property-pages--general.md).  
  
    -   **Validate Parameters** is cleared and reset to the default value. For more information, see [MIDL Property Pages: Advanced](../vs140/midl-property-pages--advanced.md).  
  
    -   If **Debug Information Format** was set to **/ZI** in the Win32 project configuration, then it is set to **/Zi** in the 64-bit project configuration. For more information, see [/Z7, /Zd, /Zi, /ZI (Debug Information Format)](../vs140/-z7---zi---zi--debug-information-format-.md).  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  None of these project properties are changed if they are overridden on the file level.
