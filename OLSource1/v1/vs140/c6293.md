# C6293
warning C6293: Ill-defined for-loop: counts down from minimum  
  
 This warning indicates that a for-loop might not function as intended. It occurs when a loop counts down from a minimum, but has a higher termination condition.  
  
 A signed —or unsigned—index variable together with a negative increment will cause the loop to count negative until an overflow occurs. This will terminate the loop.  
  
## Example  
 The following sample code generates this warning:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 To correct this warning, use the following code:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
