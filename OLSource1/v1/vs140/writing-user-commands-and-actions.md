# Writing User Commands and Actions
You can customize a domain-specific language by adding commands to the diagram, and by responding to gestures such as drag-and-drop, click, and double-click events.  
  
## User actions  
  
-   [How to Modify a Standard Menu Command](../vs140/how-to--modify-a-standard-menu-command-in-a-domain-specific-language.md) – You can customize the behavior of commands such as copy and print.  
  
-   [How to Add a command to the shortcut menu](../vs140/how-to--add-a-command-to-the-shortcut-menu.md) – Create your own commands that can update your model or external resources.  
  
-   [How to add a drag and drop handler](../vs140/how-to--add-a-drag-and-drop-handler.md) – Allow the user to move items from one diagram to another, including UML diagrams. You can store references to one model in another.  
  
-   [How to Intercept a Click](../vs140/how-to--intercept-a-click-on-a-shape-or-decorator.md) – Allow your user to click through from an item to another item that it references.  
  
-   [How to Program Copy and Paste](../vs140/how-to--program-copy-and-paste-behavior---redirect.md) – How to use ElementOperations.  
  
-   [How to access and constrain the current selection](../vs140/how-to--access-and-constrain-the-current-selection.md)  
  
-   [Customizing element tools](../vs140/customizing-element-tools.md)
