# Overloaded Operators
Operator overloading has changed significantly from Managed Extensions for C++ to [!INCLUDE[cpp_current_long](../vs140/includes/cpp_current_long_md.md)].  
  
 In the declaration of a reference type, for example, rather than using the native <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> syntax, you explicitly write out the underlying internal name of the operator â€“ in this case, <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>. In addition, the invocation of an operator has to be explicitly invoked through that name, thus precluding the two primary benefits of operator overloading: (a) the intuitive syntax, and (b) the ability to intermix new types with existing types. For example:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 In the new syntax, the usual expectations of a native C++ programmer are restored, both in the declaration and use of the static operators. Here is the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> class translated into the new syntax:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
