# An Example of the Comments
The following partial listing of class <CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> uses most of the standard comments that MFC employs in its classes to divide class members by the ways they are used:  
  
 [!code[NVC_MFCListView#5](../vs140/codesnippet/CPP/an-example-of-the-comments_1.h)]  
  
 These comments consistently mark sections of the class declaration that contain similar kinds of class members. Keep in mind that these are MFC conventions, not set rules.
