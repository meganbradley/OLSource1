 Shows how to create a [!INCLUDE[wrt](../vs140/includes/wrt_md.md)] type, package it in a [!INCLUDE[wrt](../vs140/includes/wrt_md.md)] component, and then call the component from a [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../vs140/includes/win8_appname_long_md.md)] app that's built for Windows by using JavaScript.  
  
 [Office Programming (C# and Visual Basic)](../vs140/walkthrough--office-programming--csharp-and-visual-basic-.md)

 [Creating and Using Dynamic Objects (C# and Visual Basic)](../vs140/walkthrough--creating-and-using-dynamic-objects--csharp-and-visual-basic-.md)  
 Shows how to create a custom object that dynamically exposes the contents of a text file, and how to create a project that uses the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> library.  
  
 [Authoring a Component with Visual C#](assetId:///e7a5405d-ab47-4578-bcbf-38f6cf7ccfac)  
 Shows the development of a simple component, illustrating the interaction between client and component, object lifetime and circular references, debugging clients and components, and the use of shared methods and instance methods.  
  
 [Authoring a Composite Control with Visual C#](assetId:///f88481a8-c746-4a36-9479-374ce5f2e91f)  
 Demonstrates creating a simple composite control and extending its functionality through inheritance.  
  
 [Authoring a Simple Multithreaded Component with Visual C#](assetId:///7bc03b7b-d680-499b-8179-5f414b2d650c)  
 Demonstrates creating a multithreaded component, explaining how threads work and how to coordinate multiple threads in your component.

 Demonstrates some of the commonly performed tasks such as adding or removing a tab on a <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, docking a control to its parent, and changing the orientation of a <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> control.  
  
 [Writing Queries in C# (LINQ)](../vs140/walkthrough--writing-queries-in-csharp--linq-.md)  
 Demonstrates the C# language features that are used to write [!INCLUDE[vbteclinq](../vs140/includes/vbteclinq_md.md)] query expressions.
