# Managed VSPackages
The following topics explain how to create a VSPackage. A VSPackage is a software module that extends the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] integrated development environment (IDE) by providing user interface (UI) elements, services, projects, editors, and designers. For more information, see [VSPackages](../vs140/vspackages.md).  
  
## In This Section  
 [Using Visual Studio Interop Assemblies](../vs140/using-visual-studio-interop-assemblies.md)  
 Describes the function and location of the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] interop assemblies and the namespaces they provide.  
  
 [HRESULT Information in Managed Code](../vs140/hresult-information-in-managed-code.md)  
 Discusses how to translate HRESULT information into thrown exceptions and `int` return values in managed code.  
  
 [VSIP Interop Assembly Parameter Marshaling](../vs140/visual-studio-interop-assembly-parameter-marshaling.md)  
 Discusses interoperability issues between the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] interop assemblies and COM interfaces.  
  
 [VSPackages and Managed Package Framework](../vs140/vspackages-and-the-managed-package-framework.md)  
 Describes and lists the managed package framework (MPF) class namespaces and DLL files and shows how to use them to create a VSPackage.  
  
 [Resources in Managed VSPackages](../vs140/resources-in-vspackages.md)  
 Describes the use of managed and unmanaged resources in managed VSPackages.
