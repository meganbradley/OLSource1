# How to: Test for Equality (C++-CLI)
In the following sample, a test for equality that uses Managed Extensions for C++ is based on what the handles refer to.  
  
## Example  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 The IL for this program shows that the return value is implemented by using a call to op_Equality.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
