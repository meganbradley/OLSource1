# Type &#39;&lt;typename1&gt;&#39; cannot be marked CLS-compliant because its containing type &#39;&lt;typename2&gt;&#39; is not CLS-compliant
A class or interface is marked as `<CLSCompliant(True)>` when it is nested in a type that is marked as `<CLSCompliant(False)>` or is not marked.  
  
 For a class or interface to be compliant with the [Common Language Specification](assetId:///4f0b77d0-4844-464f-af73-6e06bedeafc6) (CLS), its entire containment hierarchy must be compliant. That means every type in which it is nested must be compliant.  
  
 When you apply the \<xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute*> to a programming element, you set the attribute's `isCompliant` parameter to either `True` or `False` to indicate compliance or noncompliance. There is no default for this parameter, and you must supply a value.  
  
 If you do not apply the \<xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute*> to an element, it is considered to be noncompliant.  
  
 By default, this message is a warning. For information on hiding warnings or treating warnings as errors, see [Configuring Warnings in Visual Basic](../vs140/configuring-warnings-in-visual-basic.md).  
  
 **Error ID:** BC40030  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   If you require CLS compliance, define this type within a different containment hierarchy.  
  
-   If you require that this type remain within its current containment hierarchy, remove the \<xref:System.CLSCompliantAttribute*> from its definition or mark it as `<CLSCompliant(False)>`.
