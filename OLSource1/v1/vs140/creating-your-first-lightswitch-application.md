# Creating Your First LightSwitch Application
The best way to learn how to create a LightSwitch application is to actually create one. In this section youâ€™ll create a simple contact management application in four easy steps. This application interacts with a database and displays data on screens. It includes capabilities such as data entry, navigation, validation, search and more; all without writing a single line of code.  
  
## Step 1. Create a Project  
 A project is the container for the files that make up your application. See [Step 1: Create a LightSwitch Project](../vs140/step-1--create-a-lightswitch-project.md).  
  
## Step 2. Define the Data  
 In the contact management application, you need data that represents a name, company, telephone number and email address. See [Step 2: Define the Data](../vs140/step-2--define-the-data-in-lightswitch.md).  
  
## Step 3. Create Screens  
 In this step, you'll create screens that let you view, add, and edit your contact data. See [Step 3: Create a Screen](../vs140/step-3--create-screens-in-lightswitch.md).  
  
## Step 4. Run It!  
 The final step is to run your application and see how it works. See [Step 4: Run and Test the Application](../vs140/step-4--run-and-test-the-lightswitch-application.md).
