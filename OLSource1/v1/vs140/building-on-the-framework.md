# Building on the Framework
Your role in configuring an application with the MFC framework is to supply the application-specific source code and to connect the components by defining what messages and commands to which they respond. You use the C++ language and standard C++ techniques to derive your own application-specific classes from those supplied by the class library and to override and augment the base class's behavior.  
  
 In related topics, the following tables describe the general sequence of operations you will typically follow and your responsibilities versus the framework's responsibilities:  
  
-   [Sequence for Building an Application with the Framework](../vs140/sequence-of-operations-for-building-mfc-applications.md)  
  
-   [Sequence of Operations for Creating OLE Applications](../vs140/sequence-of-operations-for-creating-ole-applications.md)  
  
-   [Sequence of Operations for Creating ActiveX Controls](../vs140/sequence-of-operations-for-creating-activex-controls.md)  
  
-   [Sequence of Operations for Creating Database Applications](../vs140/sequence-of-operations-for-creating-database-applications.md)  
  
 For the most part, you can follow these tables as a sequence of steps for creating an MFC application, although some of the steps are alternative options. For example, most applications use one type of view class from the several types available.
