# CWnd::OnHotKey
The framework calls this member function when the user presses a system-wide hot key.  
  
## Syntax  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
#### Parameters  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|[in] <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>|Identifier for the hot key that generated the message. If the message was generated by a system-defined hot key, this parameter will be one of the following values:\<br />\<br /> -   <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> - The snap desktop hot key was pressed.\<br />-   <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> - The snap window hot key was pressed.|  
|[in] <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>|A bitwise combination (OR) of flags that indicate the keys that were pressed in combination with the key specified by the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> parameter. The possible values are:\<br />\<br /> -   <CodeContentPlaceHolder>6\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> - Either ALT key was held down.\<br />-   <CodeContentPlaceHolder>7\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> - Either CTRL key was held down.\<br />-   <CodeContentPlaceHolder>8\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> - Either SHIFT key was held down.\<br />-   <CodeContentPlaceHolder>9\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> - Either WINDOWS key was held down. These keys are labeled with the Microsoft Windows logo.|  
|[in] <CodeContentPlaceHolder>10\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>|The virtual key code of the hot key.|  
  
## Remarks  
 This method receives the [WM_HOTKEY](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646279) notification, which is described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../vs140/includes/winsdk_md.md)]. This message is placed at the top of the message queue associated with the thread that registered the hot key. Use the [RegisterHotKey](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646309) function to register a system-wide hot key.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.
