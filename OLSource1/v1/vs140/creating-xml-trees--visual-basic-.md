# Creating XML Trees (Visual Basic)
One of the most common XML tasks is constructing an XML tree. This section describes several ways to create them.  
  
## In This Section  
  
|Topic|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[Functional Construction (LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)](../vs140/functional-construction--linq-to-xml---visual-basic-.md)|Provides an overview of functional construction in [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../vs140/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)]. Functional construction enables you to create all or part of your XML tree in a single statement. This topic also shows how to embed queries when constructing an XML tree.|  
|[Introduction to XML Literals in Visual Basic](../vs140/introduction-to-xml-literals-in-visual-basic2.md)|Provides a quick introduction to creating trees in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] by using XML literals. This topic includes links to the [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] documentation of XML literals.|  
|[Cloning vs. Attaching (Visual Basic)](../vs140/cloning-vs.-attaching--visual-basic-.md)|Demonstrates the difference between adding nodes from an existing XML tree (nodes are cloned and then added) and adding nodes with no parent (they are simply attached).|  
|[Parsing XML (Visual Basic)](../vs140/parsing-xml--visual-basic-.md)|Shows how to parse XML from a variety of sources. [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../vs140/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)] is layered on top of <xref:System.Xml.XmlReader*>, which is used to parse the XML.|  
|[How to: Populate an XML Tree with an XmlWriter (LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)](../vs140/how-to--populate-an-xml-tree-with-an-xmlwriter--linq-to-xml---visual-basic-.md)|Shows how to populate an XML tree by using an <xref:System.Xml.XmlWriter*>.|  
|[How to: Validate Using XSD (LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)](../vs140/how-to--validate-using-xsd--linq-to-xml---visual-basic-.md)|Shows how to validate an XML tree using XSD.|  
|[Valid Content of XElement and XDocument Objects](../vs140/valid-content-of-xelement-and-xdocument-objects2.md)|Describes the valid arguments that can be passed to the constructors and methods that are used to add content to elements and documents.|
