# How to: Combine and Compare String Collections (LINQ) (Visual Basic)
This example shows how to merge files that contain lines of text and then sort the results. Specifically, it shows how to perform a simple concatenation, a union, and an intersection on the two sets of text lines.  
  
### To set up the project and the text files  
  
1.  Copy these names into a text file that is named names1.txt and save it in your project folder:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
2.  Copy these names into a text file that is named names2.txt and save it in your project folder. Note that the two files have some names in common.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
## Example  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
## Compiling the Code  
 Create a project that targets the .NET Framework version 3.5 or higher with a reference to System.Core.dll and a <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> statement for the System.Linq namespace.
