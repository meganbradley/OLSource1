# CWnd::OnXButtonDblClk
The framework calls this member function when the user double-clicks XBUTTON1 or XBUTTON2 while the cursor is in the client area of a window.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
afx_msg void OnXButtonDblClk(  
    UINT nFlags,   
    UINT nButton,   
    CPoint point  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|[in] `nFlags`|A bitwise combination (OR) of flags that indicate which modifier keys are pressed. For example, the `MK_CONTROL` flag indicates that the CTRL key is pressed.|  
|[in] `nButton`|A value of `XBUTTON1` if the first Microsoft Intellimouse X button is double-clicked, or `XBUTTON2` if the second X button is double-clicked.|  
|[in] `point`|A [CPoint](../vs140/cpoint-class.md) object that specifies the *x* and *y* coordinates of the cursor relative to the upper-left corner of the client area.|  
  
## Remarks  
 This method receives the [WM_XBUTTONDBLCLK](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646244) notification, which is described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../vs140/includes/winsdk_md.md)]. If the mouse is not captured, the message is posted to the window beneath the cursor. Otherwise, the message is posted to the window that has captured the mouse.  
  
 The `nFlags` parameter can be a combination of modifier keys listed in the following table. For more information, see [About Mouse Input](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms645601).

|MK_XBUTTON2|The XBUTTON2 mouse button of the Microsoft IntelliMouse is pressed.|  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.
