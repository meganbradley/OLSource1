# Internationalization
The Microsoft run-time library provides many routines that are useful for creating different versions of a program for international markets. This includes [locale-related routines](../vs140/locale.md), wide-character routines, multibyte-character routines, and generic-text routines. For convenience, most locale-related routines are also categorized in this reference according to the operations they perform. In this section and in the alphabetic reference, multibyte-character routines and wide-character routines are described with single-byte-character counterparts, where they exist.  
  
 Also included are the ISO646 operator alternatives.  
  
 For information about .NET Framework equivalents, see [System::Globalization::CultureInfo Class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.cultureinfo.aspx).
