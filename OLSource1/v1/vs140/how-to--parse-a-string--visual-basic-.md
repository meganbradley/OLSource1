# How to: Parse a String (Visual Basic)
This topic shows how to create an XML tree in C#.  
  
## Example  
 You can parse a string in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] by using the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> method. However, it is more efficient to use XML literals, as shown in following code, because XML literals do not suffer from the same performance penalties as parsing XML from a string.  
  
 By using XML literals, you can just copy and paste your XML into your [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] program.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Parsing text or loading an XML document from a text file is less efficient than functional construction. If you are initializing an XML tree from code, it takes less processor time to use functional construction than to parse text.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
