# Collecting Memory Data from an ASP.NET Web Application by Using the Profiler Command Line
This section describes the procedures and options for collecting memory allocation and object lifetime data for an ASP.NET Web application by using the **VSPerfCmd** command-line tool.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The **VSPerfCmd** tool provides you with complete access to Profiling Tools functionality, including pausing and resuming profiling, and collecting additional data from processor and Windows performance counters. You can also use the  **VSPerfASPNETCmd** command-line tool when you do not need this functionality. Compared with the [VSPerfCmd](../vs140/vsperfcmd.md) command line tool, no environment variables need to be set, and rebooting the computer is not required. For more information, see [Rapid Web Site Profiling with VSPerfASPNETCmd](../vs140/rapid-web-site-profiling-with-vsperfaspnetcmd.md).
