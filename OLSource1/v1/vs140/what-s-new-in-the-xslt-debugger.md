# What&#39;s New in the XSLT Debugger
The following features are new in Visual Studio 2010.  
  
## XSLT Profiler  
 The XSLT Profiler is a tool that allows developers to measure, evaluate, and target performance-related problems in XSLT code by creating detailed XSLT performance reports. For more information, see [XSLT Profiler](../vs140/xslt-profiler.md).
