# MFC Support in ATL Projects
If you select **Support MFC** in the ATL Project Wizard, your project declares the application as an MFC application object (class). The project initializes the MFC library and instantiates a class (class *ProjName*) that is derived from [CWinApp](../vs140/cwinapp-class.md).  
  
 This option is available for nonattributed ATL DLL projects only.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 You can view the application object class and its <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> and <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> functions in Class View.
