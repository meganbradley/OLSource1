# Development with My (Visual Basic)
Visual Basic provides new features for rapid application development that improve productivity and ease of use while delivering power. One of these features, called <CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, provides access to information and default object instances that are related to the application and its run-time environment. This information is organized in a format that is discoverable through IntelliSense and logically delineated according to use.  
  
 Top-level members of <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> are exposed as objects. Each object behaves similarly to a namespace or a class with <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> members, and it exposes a set of related members.  
  
 This table shows the top-level <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> objects and their relationship to each other.
