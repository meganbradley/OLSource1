# Getting Started with LightSwitch
You can build business applications quickly by concentrating on the business logic instead of the application infrastructure if you use the simplified development environment of Visual Studio LightSwitch.  
  
 For a quick introduction to the LightSwitch development environment and its most common features, see [Walkthrough: Creating the Vision Clinic Application](../vs140/walkthrough--creating-the-vision-clinic-application-in-lightswitch.md), which demonstrates how to create an application for a fictional vision clinic.  
  
 For a more detailed introduction, see [LightSwitch Guided Tour](../vs140/lightswitch-guided-tour.md), which explains not only what you're doing but also why.
