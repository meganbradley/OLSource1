# How to: Refer to the Current Instance of an Object (Visual Basic)
The *current instance* of an object is the instance in which the code is currently executing.  
  
 You use the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> keyword to refer to the current instance.  
  
### To refer to the current instance  
  
-   Use the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> keyword where you would normally use the name of an object variable.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
     Although <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> behaves like an object variable, you cannot declare it or assign anything to it. <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> always refers to the current instance.
