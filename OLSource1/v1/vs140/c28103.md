# C28103
warning C28103: Leaking resource  
  
 The specified object contains a resource that has not been freed. A function being called has been annotated with <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> or <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> and this warning indicates that the resource named in the annotation was not freed.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example generates this warning:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 The following code example avoids this warning:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 If this warning is reported as a false positive, the most likely cause is that the function that releases the resource is not annotated with <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> or <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>. Note that if you are using wrapper functions for system functions, the wrapper functions should use the same annotations that the system functions do. Currently, many system functions are annotated in the model file, so the annotations are not visible in the header files.
