# 2.7.2.3 lastprivate
The <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> clause provides a superset of the functionality provided by the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> clause. The syntax of the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> clause is as follows:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 Variables specified in the *variable-list* have <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> clause semantics. When a <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> clause appears on the directive that identifies a work-sharing construct, the value of each <CodeContentPlaceHolder>6\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> variable from the sequentially last iteration of the associated loop, or the lexically last section directive, is assigned to the variable's original object. Variables that are not assigned a value by the last iteration of the **for** or **parallel for**, or by the lexically last section of the **sections** or **parallel sections** directive, have indeterminate values after the construct. Unassigned subobjects also have an indeterminate value after the construct.  
  
 The restrictions to the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>7\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> clause are as follows:  
  
-   All restrictions for <CodeContentPlaceHolder>8\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> apply.  
  
-   A variable with a class type that is specified as <CodeContentPlaceHolder>9\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> must have an accessible, unambiguous copy assignment operator.  
  
-   Variables that are private within a parallel region or that appear in the <CodeContentPlaceHolder>10\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> clause of a **parallel** directive cannot be specified in a <CodeContentPlaceHolder>11\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> clause on a work-sharing directive that binds to the parallel construct.
