# Formatting Time: Automation Classes
#### To format a time  
  
1.  Use the **Format** member function of either [COleDateTime](../vs140/coledatetime-class.md) or [COleDateTimeSpan](../vs140/coledatetimespan-class.md) to create a character string representing the time or elapsed time.  
  
     [!code[NVC_ATLMFC_Utilities#179](../vs140/codesnippet/CPP/formatting-time--automation-classes_1.cpp)]  
  
 For more information, see class [COleVariant](../vs140/colevariant-class.md).
