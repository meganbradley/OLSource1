# &#39;&lt;membername&gt;&#39; cannot expose type &#39;&lt;typename&gt;&#39; outside the project through &lt;containertype&gt; &#39;&lt;containertypename&gt;&#39;
A variable, procedure parameter, or function return is exposed outside its container, but it is declared as a type that must not be exposed outside the container.  
  
 The following skeleton code shows a situation that generates this error.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 A type that is declared <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>, or <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> is intended to have limited access outside its declaration context. Using it as the data type of a variable with less restricted access would defeat this purpose. In the preceding skeleton code, <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> is <CodeContentPlaceHolder>6\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> and would expose <CodeContentPlaceHolder>7\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> to code that should not have access to it.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30909  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Change the access level of the variable, procedure parameter, or function return to be at least as restrictive as the access level of its data type.
