# Signed Bitwise Operations
**ANSI 3.3** The results of bitwise operations on signed integers  
  
 Bitwise operations on signed integers work the same as bitwise operations on unsigned integers. For example, <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> can be expressed in binary as  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 The result of the bitwise AND is 96.
