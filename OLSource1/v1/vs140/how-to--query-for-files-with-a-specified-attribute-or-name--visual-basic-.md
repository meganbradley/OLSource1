# How to: Query for Files with a Specified Attribute or Name (Visual Basic)
This example shows how to find all files that have a specified file name extension (for example ".txt") in a specified directory tree. It also shows how to return either the newest or oldest file in the tree based on the creation time.  
  
## Example  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
## Compiling the Code  
 Create a project that targets the .NET Framework version 3.5 or higher with a reference to System.Core.dll and a   <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> statement for the System.Linq namespace.
