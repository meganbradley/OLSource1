# Private Virtual Functions
The way private virtual functions are handled in derived classes has changed from Managed Extensions for C++ to [!INCLUDE[cpp_current_long](../vs140/includes/cpp_current_long_md.md)].  
  
 In Managed Extensions, the access level of a virtual function does not constrain its ability to be overridden within a derived class. In the new syntax, a virtual function cannot override a base class virtual function that it cannot access. For example:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 There is no real mapping of this sort of design onto the new syntax. One simply has to make the base class members accessible â€“ that is, non-private. The inherited methods do not have to bear the same access. In this example, the least invasive change is to make the MyBaseClass member <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>. This way the general program's access to the method through MyBaseClass is still prohibited.  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 Note that the absence of the explicit <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> keyword in the base class, under the new syntax, generates a warning message.
