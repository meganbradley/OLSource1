# Overview (Debug Interface Access SDK)
Use the DIA SDK to access the Microsoft debug information. The DIA SDK provides a COM based API set that eliminates the need to rewrite your code whenever Microsoft changes the format of the debug information. The DIA SDK also allows you to read from a select set of previous versions of debug information, located in .pdb and .dbg files generated by [!INCLUDE[vcprvc](../vs140/includes/vcprvc_md.md)] versions 5.0 and later.  
  
 Each interface in the DIA SDK represents a different COM object, except where stated otherwise. Additional interfaces, and thus additional objects, are created by means of explicit queries, such as [IDiaDataSource::openSession](../vs140/idiadatasource--opensession.md) or [IDiaSession::findChildren](../vs140/idiasession--findchildren.md), rather than by calling `QueryInterface` on existing interface pointers.
