# How to: Read a Binary File (C++-CLI)
The following code example shows how to read binary data from a file, by using two classes from the \<xref:System.IO*?displayProperty=fullName> namespace: \<xref:System.IO.FileStream*> and \<xref:System.IO.BinaryReader*>. \<xref:System.IO.FileStream*> represents the actual file. \<xref:System.IO.BinaryReader*> provides an interface to the stream that allows binary access.  
  
 The code example reads a file that's named data.bin and contains integers in binary format. For information about this kind of file, see [How to: Write A Binary File](../vs140/how-to--write-a-binary-file--c---cli-.md).
