# Determining Object Type (Visual Basic)
Generic object variables (that is, variables you declare as `Object`) can hold objects from any class. When using variables of type `Object`, you may need to take different actions based on the class of the object; for example, some objects might not support a particular property or method. [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] provides two means of determining which type of object is stored in an object variable: the `TypeName` function and the `TypeOf...Is` operator.  
  
## TypeName and TypeOfâ€¦Is  
 The `TypeName` function returns a string and is the best choice when you need to store or display the class name of an object, as shown in the following code fragment:  
  
 [!code[VbVbalrOOP#92](../vs140/codesnippet/VisualBasic/determining-object-type--visual-basic-_1.vb)]  
  
 The `TypeOf...Is` operator is the best choice for testing an object's type, because it is much faster than an equivalent string comparison using `TypeName`. The following code fragment uses `TypeOf...Is` within an `If...Then...Else` statement:  
  
 [!code[VbVbalrOOP#93](../vs140/codesnippet/VisualBasic/determining-object-type--visual-basic-_2.vb)]  
  
 A word of caution is due here. The `TypeOf...Is` operator returns `True` if an object is of a specific type, or is derived from a specific type. Almost everything you do with [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../vs140/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] involves objects, which include some elements not normally thought of as objects, such as strings and integers. These objects are derived from and inherit methods from <xref:System.Object*>. When passed an `Integer` and evaluated with `Object`, the `TypeOf...Is` operator returns `True`. The following example reports that the parameter `InParam` is both an `Object` and an `Integer`:  
  
 [!code[VbVbalrOOP#94](../vs140/codesnippet/VisualBasic/determining-object-type--visual-basic-_3.vb)]  
  
 The following example uses both `TypeOf...Is` and `TypeName` to determine the type of object passed to it in the `Ctrl` argument. The `TestObject` procedure calls `ShowType` with three different kinds of controls.  
  
#### To run the example  
  
1.  Create a new Windows Application project and add a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.Button*> control, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.CheckBox*> control, and a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.RadioButton*> control to the form.  
  
2.  From the button on your form, call the `TestObject` procedure.  
  
3.  Add the following code to your form:
