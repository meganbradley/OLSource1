# Identifier is too long
The name, or identifier, of every programming element is limited to 1023 characters. In addition, a fully qualified name cannot exceed 1023 characters. This means that the entire identifier string (<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>) cannot be more than 1023 characters long, including the member-access operator (<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>) characters.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30033  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Reduce the length of the identifier.
