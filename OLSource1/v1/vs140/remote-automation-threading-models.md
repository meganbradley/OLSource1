# Remote Automation Threading Models
Remote Automation supports both the single-threaded and the apartment-threaded models of COM. On 32-bit and 64-bit platforms, which are all that Visual C++ supports, the threading model should be set to "apartment." For more information on how and where to do this, see [Creating Programs That Use Remote Automation](../vs140/creating-programs-that-use-remote-automation.md).
