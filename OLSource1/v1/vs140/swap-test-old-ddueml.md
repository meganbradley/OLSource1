Quick Guidance
---
When you are authoring your Markdown content in CAPS, you could get help from different ways:
- Use <CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> in IE or <CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> in Chrome to open <CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
- Use <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> at any place to open insert.
- Use authoring tool bar on the top of the editor to help create your content

Format your content
---
- **Paragraph**
  Paragraphs in Markdown are just one or more lines of consecutive text followed by one or more blank lines.
  
  <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
  
- **Headings**  
  You can either you header dropdown list provided in the authoring toolbar, or manually add '---' or '===' in the     next line under your section title. You can also create a heading by adding one or more <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> symbols before your     heading text. The number of <CodeContentPlaceHolder>6\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> you use will determine the size of the heading.

  <CodeContentPlaceHolder>7\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>

- **Block quotes**
  You can indicate block quotes with a <CodeContentPlaceHolder>8\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>.
  <CodeContentPlaceHolder>9\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>

- **Styling text**
  You can make your text **Bold** or *italic*
  <CodeContentPlaceHolder>10\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
  You can also use authoring toolbar to achieve this

- **Lists**
  You can add an unordered list by preceding list items with <CodeContentPlaceHolder>11\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> or <CodeContentPlaceHolder>12\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
  <CodeContentPlaceHolder>13\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
  You can add ordered list by preceding list items with a number
  <CodeContentPlaceHolder>14\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
  You can create nested lists by indenting list items by two spaces.
  <CodeContentPlaceHolder>15\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>

- **Code formatting**
  You can use triple ticks (<CodeContentPlaceHolder>16\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
  x = 0
  x = 2 + 2
  what is x
  <CodeContentPlaceHolder>17\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>[Link Label]<CodeContentPlaceHolder>18\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>(http://URL)<CodeContentPlaceHolder>19\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>![Image Label]<CodeContentPlaceHolder>20\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>(http://ImageURL)`
  
  You can also insert an image from CAPS with the authoring toolbar


Using tables in your content
---
You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell

You can also include inline Markdown format syntax such as links, bold, italics, or strike through:

| Name | Description          |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Help      | ~~Display the~~ help window.|
| Close     | _Closes_ a window     |

You can have more formatting control by including colons : within the header row, you can define text to be left-aligned, right-aligned, or center-aligned:

| Left-Aligned  | Center Aligned  | Right Aligned |
| :------------ |:---------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | some wordy text | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered        |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat        |    $1 |

A colon on the **left-most** side indicates a left-aligned column; a colon on the **right-most** side indicates a right-aligned column; a colon on **both** sides indicates a center-aligned column.
