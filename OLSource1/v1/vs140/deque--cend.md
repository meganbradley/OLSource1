# deque::cend
Returns a `const` iterator that addresses the location just beyond the last element in a range.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
const_iterator cend() const;  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 A random-access iterator that points just beyond the end of the range.  
  
## Remarks  
 `cend` is used to test whether an iterator has passed the end of its range.  
  
 You can use this member function in place of the `end()` member function to guarantee that the return value is `const_iterator`. Typically, it's used in conjunction with the [auto](../vs140/auto--c---.md) type deduction keyword, as shown in the following example. In the example, consider `Container` to be a modifiable (non-`const`) container of any kind that supports `end()` and `cend()`.  
  
```cpp  
  
auto i1 = Container.end();  // i1 is Container<T>::iterator   
auto i2 = Container.cend(); // i2 is Container<T>::const_iterator  
```  
  
 The value returned by `cend` should not be dereferenced.
