# CWnd::OnRawInput
The framework calls this member function when the current window gets raw input.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
afx_msg void OnRawInput(  
    UINT nInputCode,  
    HRAWINPUT hRawInput  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
  
|Parameter|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|[in] `nInputCode`|Input code that indicates whether the input occurred while the application was in the foreground or not. In either case, the application must call [CWnd::DefWindowProc](../vs140/cwnd--defwindowproc.md) so the system can perform cleanup.<br /><br /> This parameter can be one of the following values:<br /><br /> -   `RIM_INPUT` - Input occurred while the application was in the foreground.<br />-   `RIM_INPUTSINK` - Input occurred while the application was not in the foreground.|  
|[in] `hRawInput`|Handle to a [RAWINPUT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms645562) structure that contains the raw input from the device.|  
  
## Remarks  
 This method receives the [WM_INPUT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms646275) notification, which is described in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../vs140/includes/winsdk_md.md)].  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This member function is called by the framework to allow your application to handle a Windows message. The parameters passed to your function reflect the parameters received by the framework when the message was received. If you call the base-class implementation of this function, that implementation will use the parameters originally passed with the message and not the parameters you supply to the function.  
  
## Requirements  
 **Header:** afxwin.h  
  
 This method is supported in [!INCLUDE[windowsver](../vs140/includes/windowsver_md.md)] and later.  
  
 Additional requirements for this method are described in [Build Requirements for Vista Common Controls](../vs140/build-requirements-for-windows-vista-common-controls.md).
