# CFile::Read
Reads data into a buffer from the file associated with the `CFile` object.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
      virtual UINT Read(  
   void* lpBuf,  
   UINT nCount   
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `lpBuf`  
 Pointer to the user-supplied buffer that is to receive the data read from the file.  
  
 `nCount`  
 The maximum number of bytes to be read from the file. For text-mode files, carriage returnâ€“linefeed pairs are counted as single characters.  
  
## Return Value  
 The number of bytes transferred to the buffer. Note that for all `CFile` classes, the return value may be less than `nCount` if the end of file was reached.  
  
## Example  
 [!code[NVC_MFCFiles#15](../vs140/codesnippet/CPP/cfile--read_1.cpp)]  
  
 For another example see [CFile::Open](../vs140/cfile--open.md).
