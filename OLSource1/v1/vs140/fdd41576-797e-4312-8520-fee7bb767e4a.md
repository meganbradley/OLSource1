# How to: Attach the Profiler to a .NET Framework Stand-Alone Application to Collect Concurrency Data by Using the Command Line
This topic describes how to use [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../vs140/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Profiling Tools command-line tools to attach the Profiler to a running .NET Framework stand-alone (client) application and collect process and thread concurrency data.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Command-line tools of the Profiling Tools are located in the \Team Tools\Performance Tools subdirectory of the [!INCLUDE[vs_current_short](../vs140/includes/vs_current_short_md.md)] installation directory. On 64 bit computers, both 64 bit and 32 bit versions of the tools are available. To use the profiler command-line tools, you must add the tools path to the PATH environment variable of the command prompt window or add it to  the command itself. For more information, see [Specifying the Path to Profiling Tools Command Line Tools](../vs140/specifying-the-path-to-profiling-tools-command-line-tools.md).  
  
 While the profiler is attached to the application, you can pause and resume data collection. To end a profiling session, the Profiler must no longer be attached to the application and the Profiler must be explicitly shut down.  
  
## Attaching the Profiler  
  
#### To attach the Profiler to a running .NET Framework application  
  
1.  Open a command prompt window.  
  
2.  Start the profiler. Type:  
  
     [VSPerfCmd](../vs140/vsperfcmd.md) **/start:concurrency  /output:** <CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> [<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>]  
  
     The [/output](../vs140/output.md)**:**<CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> option is required with **/start**. <CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> specifies the name and location of the profiling data (.vsp) file.  
  
     You can use any of the following options with the **/start:concurrency** option.  
  
    |Option|Description|  
    |------------|-----------------|  
    |[/wincounter](../vs140/wincounter.md) **:** <CodeContentPlaceHolder>4\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>|Specifies a Windows performance counter to be collected during profiling.|  
    |[/automark](../vs140/automark.md) **:** <CodeContentPlaceHolder>5\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>|Use with **/wincounter** only. Specifies the number of milliseconds between Windows performance counter collection events. Default is 500 ms.|  
    |[/events](../vs140/events--vsperfcmd-.md) **:** <CodeContentPlaceHolder>6\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>|Specifies an Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) event to be collected during profiling. ETW events are collected in a separate (.etl) file.|  
  
3.  Start the target application in the typical way.  
  
4.  Attach the profiler to the target application. Type:  
  
     **VSPerfCmd /attach:** <CodeContentPlaceHolder>7\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> [**/lineoff**] [**/targetclr:**<CodeContentPlaceHolder>8\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>]  
  
    -   <CodeContentPlaceHolder>9\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> specifies the process ID of the target application. You can view the process IDs of all running processes in Windows Task Manager.  
  
    -   [/lineoff](../vs140/lineoff.md) disables the collection of line number data.  
  
    -   [/targetclr](../vs140/targetclr.md) **:** <CodeContentPlaceHolder>10\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> specifies the version of the common language runtime (CLR) to profile when more than one version of the runtime is loaded in an application. Optional.  
  
## Controlling Data Collection  
 While the target application is running, you can control data collection by starting and stopping the writing of data to the file by using VSPerfCmd.exe options. Controlling data collection enables you to collect data for a specific part of program execution, such as the starting or shutting down of the application.  
  
#### To start and stop data collection  
  
-   The following pairs of VSPerfCmd.exe options start and stop data collection. Specify each option on a separate command-line. You can turn data collection on and off multiple times.  
  
    |Option|Description|  
    |------------|-----------------|  
    |[/globalon /globaloff](../vs140/globalon-and-globaloff.md)|Starts (**/globalon**) or stops (**/globaloff**) data collection for all processes.|  
    |[/processon](../vs140/processon-and-processoff.md) **:** <CodeContentPlaceHolder>11\</CodeContentPlaceHolder> [/processoff](../vs140/processon-and-processoff.md) **:** <CodeContentPlaceHolder>12\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>|Starts (**/processon**) or stops (**/processoff**) data collection for the process specified by the process ID (<CodeContentPlaceHolder>13\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>).|  
    |[/attach](../vs140/attach.md) **:**{<CodeContentPlaceHolder>14\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>&#124;<CodeContentPlaceHolder>15\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>} [/detach](../vs140/detach.md)[**:**{<CodeContentPlaceHolder>16\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>&#124;<CodeContentPlaceHolder>17\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>}]|**/attach** starts to collect data for the process specified by the process ID (<CodeContentPlaceHolder>18\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>) or process name (ProcName). **/detach** stops data collection for the specified process or for all processes if a specific process is not specified.|  
  
## Ending the profiling session  
 To end a profiling session, the profiler must not be collecting data. You can stop collecting data from a application profiled with the concurrency method by closing the application or by invoking the **VSPerfCmd /detach** option. You then invoke the **VSPerfCmd /shutdown** option to turn the profiler off and close the profiling data file. The **VSPerfClrEnv /off** command clears the profiling environment variables.  
  
#### To end a profiling session  
  
1.  Do one of the following to detach the profiler from the target application.  
  
    -   Type **VSPerfCmd /detach**  
  
         -or-  
  
    -   Close the target application.  
  
2.  Shut down the profiler. Type:  
  
     VSPerfCmd[/shutdown](../vs140/shutdown.md)
