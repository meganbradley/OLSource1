# Compiler Error C2865
'function' : illegal comparison for handle_or_pointer  
  
 You can compare references to [Classes and Structs (Managed)](../vs140/classes-and-structs---c---component-extensions-.md) or [__gc](../vs140/__gc.md) types only for equality to see if they refer to the same object (==) or to different objects (!=).  
  
 You cannot compare them for ordering because the .NET runtime might move managed objects at any time, changing the outcome of the test.
