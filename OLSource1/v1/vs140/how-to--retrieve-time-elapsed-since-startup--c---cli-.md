# How to: Retrieve Time Elapsed Since Startup (C++-CLI)
The following code example demonstrates how to determine the tick count, or number of milliseconds that have elapsed since Windows was started. This value is stored in the \<xref:System.Environment.TickCount*?displayProperty=fullName> member and, because it is a 32-bit value, resets to zero approximately every 24.9 days.
