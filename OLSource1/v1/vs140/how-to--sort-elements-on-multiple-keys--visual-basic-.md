# How to: Sort Elements on Multiple Keys (Visual Basic)
This topic shows how to sort on multiple keys.  
  
## Example  
 In this example, the results are ordered first by the shipping postal code, then by the order date.  
  
 This example uses the following XML document: [Sample XML File: Customers and Orders (LINQ to XML)](../vs140/sample-xml-file--customers-and-orders--linq-to-xml-1.md).  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>0\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 This code produces the following output:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>1\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
## Example  
 The following example shows the same query for XML that is in a namespace. For more information, see [Working with XML Namespaces (Visual Basic)](../vs140/working-with-xml-namespaces--visual-basic-.md).  
  
 This example uses the following XML document: [Sample XML File: Customers and Orders in a Namespace](../vs140/sample-xml-file--customers-and-orders-in-a-namespace1.md).  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>2\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>  
 This code produces the following output:  
  
<CodeContentPlaceHolder>3\</CodeContentPlaceHolder>
