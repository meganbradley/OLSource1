# Supporting Navigation in a Record View  (MFC Data Access)
This topic explains how to support movement from record to record in your record view, including information about:  
  
-   [Command handling](../VS_csharp/command-handlers-for-record-scrolling---mfc-data-access-.md) for record scrolling commands.  
  
-   [User-interface update handlers for scrolling](../VS_csharp/user-interface-updating-for-record-views---mfc-data-access-.md) commands.  
  
 The information in these topics applies to both [CRecordView](../VS_csharp/crecordview-class.md) (ODBC) and [CDaoRecordView](../VS_csharp/cdaorecordview-class.md) (DAO).
