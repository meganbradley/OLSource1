# Working with a Header Control
The easy way to use a header control ([CHeaderCtrl](../VS_csharp/cheaderctrl-class.md)) is in conjunction with a list control; see [Using CListCtrl](../VS_csharp/using-clistctrl.md) later in this topic family. You can also use a header control by itself. MFC calls **InitCommonControls** for you. The key tasks are as follows:  
  
-   [Creating the header control](../VS_csharp/creating-the-header-control.md)  
  
-   [Adding items to the header control](../VS_csharp/adding-items-to-the-header-control.md)  
  
-   [Ordering items in the header control](../VS_csharp/ordering-items-in-the-header-control.md)  
  
-   [Processing header-control notifications](../VS_csharp/processing-header-control-notifications.md)  
  
 If the header control object is embedded in a parent view or dialog class, the control is destroyed when the parent is destroyed.
