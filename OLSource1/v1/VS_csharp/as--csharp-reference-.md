# as (C# Reference)
You can use the `as` operator to perform certain types of conversions between compatible reference types or [nullable types](../VS_csharp/nullable-types--csharp-programming-guide-.md). The following code shows an example.  
  
 [!code[csrefKeywordsOperator#1](../VS_csharp/codesnippet/CSharp/as--csharp-reference-_1.cs)]  
  
## Remarks  
 The `as` operator is like a cast operation. However, if the conversion isn't possible, `as` returns `null` instead of raising an exception. Consider the following example:  
  
```  
expression as type  
```  
  
 The code is equivalent to the following expression except that the `expression` variable is evaluated only one time.  
  
```  
expression is type ? (type)expression : (type)null  
```  
  
 Note that the `as` operator performs only reference conversions, nullable conversions, and boxing conversions. The `as` operator can't perform other conversions, such as user-defined conversions, which should instead be performed by using cast expressions.
