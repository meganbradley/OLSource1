# Debugging Support Classes
MFC provides the following classes to help you debug dynamic memory allocation problems.  
  
 [CDumpContext](../VS_csharp/cdumpcontext-class.md)  
 Provides a destination for diagnostic dumps.  
  
 [CMemoryState](../VS_csharp/cmemorystate-structure.md)  
 Structure that provides snapshots of memory use. Also used to compare earlier and later memory snapshots.
