# NMAKE Reference
The Microsoft Program Maintenance Utility (NMAKE.EXE) is a command-line tool included with [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../VS_csharp/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] that builds projects based on commands that are contained in a description file.  
  
 To use NMAKE, you must run it in a Developer Command Prompt window. A Developer Command Prompt window has the environment variables set for the tools, libraries, and include file paths required to build at the command line. For details on how to open a Developer Command Prompt window, see [Building on the Command Line](../VS_csharp/building-on-the-command-line.md).
