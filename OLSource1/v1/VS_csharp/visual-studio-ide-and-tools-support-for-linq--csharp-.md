# Visual Studio IDE and Tools Support for LINQ (C#)
The Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE) provides the following features that support LINQ application development:  
  
## Object Relational Designer  
 The Object Relational Designer is a visual design tool that you can use in [LINQ to SQL](../Topic/LINQ%20to%20SQL.md) applications to generate classes in C# that represent the relational data in an underlying database. For more information, see [LINQ to SQL Tools in Visual Studio](../Topic/LINQ%20to%20SQL%20Tools%20in%20Visual%20Studio2.md).  
  
## SQLMetal Command Line Tool  
 SQLMetal is a command-line tool that can be used in build processes to generate classes from existing databases for use in LINQ to SQL  applications. For more information, see [SqlMetal.exe (Code Generation Tool)](../Topic/SqlMetal.exe%20\(Code%20Generation%20Tool\).md).  
  
## LINQ-Aware Code Editor  
 The C# code editor supports LINQ extensively with IntelliSense and formatting capabilities.  
  
## Visual Studio Debugger Support  
 The Visual Studio debugger supports debugging of query expressions. For more information, see [Debugging LINQ](../Topic/Debugging%20LINQ.md).
