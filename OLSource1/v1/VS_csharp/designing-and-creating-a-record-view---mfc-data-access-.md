# Designing and Creating a Record View  (MFC Data Access)
You can create your record view class with the [MFC Application Wizard](../VS_csharp/database-support--mfc-application-wizard.md). If you use an application wizard, it creates the record view class and a dialog template resource for it (without controls). You must use the Visual C++ Dialog editor to add controls to the dialog template resource. On the other hand, if you use **Add Class**, you must first create the dialog template resource in the Dialog editor and then create the record view class.  
  
 This information applies to both `CRecordView` and `CDaoRecordView`.  
  
#### To create your record view with the MFC Application Wizard  
  
1.  See [Database Support, MFC Application Wizard](../VS_csharp/database-support--mfc-application-wizard.md).  
  
#### To design your form  
  
1.  See [Dialog Editor](../VS_csharp/dialog-editor.md).  
  
#### To create your record view class  
  
1.  See [Adding an MFC ODBC Consumer](../VS_csharp/adding-an-mfc-odbc-consumer.md).
