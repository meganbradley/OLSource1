# Scrolling, Arranging, Sorting, and Finding in List Controls
List controls ([CListCtrl](../VS_csharp/clistctrl-class.md)) are scrollable by default. For more information, see [Scroll Position](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb774736) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../VS_csharp/includes/winsdk_md.md)] and the [Scroll](../Topic/CListCtrl::Scroll.md) member function.  
  
 You can call `CListCtrl` member functions to arrange list items in the control, sort items, and find particular items. For more information, see [Arranging, Sorting, and Finding](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb774736) in the [!INCLUDE[winSDK](../VS_csharp/includes/winsdk_md.md)] and the [CListCtrl](../VS_csharp/clistctrl-class.md) members [Arrange](../Topic/CListCtrl::Arrange.md), [SortItems](../Topic/CListCtrl::SortItems.md), and [FindItem](../Topic/CListCtrl::FindItem.md).
