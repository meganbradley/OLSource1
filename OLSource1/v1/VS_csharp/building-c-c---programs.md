# Building C-C++ Programs
You can build Visual C++ projects either in Visual Studio or on the command line. The Visual Studio IDE uses [MSBuild](../VS_csharp/msbuild--visual-c---.md) to build projects and solutions. On the command line, you can use the C/C++ compiler (cl.exe) and linker (link.exe) to build simple projects. To build more complex projects on the command line, you can use MSBuild or [NMAKE](../VS_csharp/nmake-reference.md). For an overview about how to use [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../VS_csharp/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] to build projects and solutions, see [Building Applications in Visual Studio](../VS_csharp/compiling-and-building-in-visual-studio.md).  
  
## In This Section  
 [Building C++ Projects in Visual Studio](../VS_csharp/building-c---projects-in-visual-studio.md)  
 Discusses how to use the Visual Studio IDE to build your C/C++ project.  
  
 [Building on the Command Line](../VS_csharp/building-on-the-command-line.md)  
 Discusses how to use the C/C++ command-line compiler and build tools that are included in Visual Studio.  
  
 [Building C/C++ Isolated Applications and Side-by-side Assemblies](../VS_csharp/building-c-c---isolated-applications-and-side-by-side-assemblies.md)  
 Describes the deployment model for Windows Desktop applications, based on the idea of isolated applications and side-by-side assemblies.  
  
 [C/C++ Building Reference](../VS_csharp/c-c---building-reference.md)  
 Provides links to reference articles about program building in C++, compiler and linker options, and various build tools.  
  
 [Configuring Programs for 64-Bit](../VS_csharp/configuring-programs-for-64-bit--visual-c---.md)  
 Describes how to configure both Visual Studio and the command line to use the 64-bit toolset and how to target 64-bit architectures, and discusses common migration issues when code is moved to 64-bit architectures.  
  
 [Configuring Programs for ARM Processors](../VS_csharp/configuring-programs-for-arm-processors--visual-c---.md)  
 Describes the conventions used by ARM processors, and discusses common migration issues when code is moved to ARM architectures.  
  
 [Configuring C++ 11 Programs for Windows XP](../VS_csharp/configuring-programs-for-windows-xp.md)
