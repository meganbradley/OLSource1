# C++ Language Reference
This reference explains the C++ programming language as implemented in Microsoft Visual C++. The organization is based on *The Annotated C++ Reference Manual* by Margaret Ellis and Bjarne Stroustrup and on the ANSI/ISO C++ International Standard (ISO/IEC FDIS 14882). Microsoft-specific implementations of C++ language features are included.  
  
 See the following tables to quickly find a keyword or operator:  
  
-   [C++ Keywords](../VS_csharp/keywords--c---.md)  
  
-   [C++ Operators](../VS_csharp/c---built-in-operators--precedence-and-associativity.md)  
  
## In This Section  
 [Lexical Conventions](../VS_csharp/lexical-conventions.md)  
 Fundamental lexical elements of a C++ program: tokens, comments, operators, keywords, punctuators, literals. Also, file translation, operator precedence/associativity.  
  
 [Basic Concepts](../VS_csharp/basic-concepts---c---.md)  
 Scope, linkage, program startup and termination, storage classes, and types.  
  
 [Standard Conversions](../VS_csharp/standard-conversions.md)  
 Type conversions between built-in, or "fundamental," types. Also, arithmetic conversions and conversions among pointer, reference, and pointer-to-member types.  
  
 [Operators, Precedence and Associativity](../VS_csharp/c---built-in-operators--precedence-and-associativity.md)  
 The operators in C++.  
  
 [Expressions](../VS_csharp/expressions--c---.md)  
 Types of expressions, semantics of expressions, reference topics on operators, casting and casting operators, run-time type information.  
  
 [Lambda Expressions](../VS_csharp/lambda-expressions-in-c--.md)  
 A programming technique that implicitly defines a function object class and constructs a function object of that class type.  
  
 [Statements](../VS_csharp/statements--c---.md)  
 Expression, null, compound, selection, iteration, jump, and declaration statements.  
  
 [Declarations](../Topic/Declarations.md)  
 Storage-class specifiers, function definitions, initializations, enumerations, class, struct, and union declarations, and typedef declarations. Also, inline functions, const keyword, namespaces.  
  
 [Declarators](assetId:///8a7b9b51-92bd-4ac0-b3fe-0c4abe771838)  
 The portion of a declaration statement that names an object, type, or function. Abstract declarators, type names, initializers, function declarations and definitions, arrays, references.  
  
 [Classes, Structures, and Unions](../VS_csharp/classes-and-structs--c---.md)  
 Introduction to classes, structures, and unions. Also, member functions, data members, bit fields, this pointer, nested classes.  
  
 [Derived Classes](../VS_csharp/inheritance---c---.md)  
 Single and multiple inheritance, virtual functions, multiple base classes, abstract classes, scope rules. Also, the __super and \__interface keywords.  
  
 [Member-Access Control](../VS_csharp/member-access-control--c---.md)  
 Controlling access to class members: public, private, and protected keywords. Friend functions and classes.  
  
 [Special Member Functions](../Topic/Special%20Member%20Functions%20\(C++\).md)  
 Special functions unique to class types: constructors, destructors, conversion functions, assignment operator, operator new and operator delete functions.  
  
 [Overloading](../Topic/Overloading%20%20\(C++\).md)  
 Overloaded functions, declaration matching, argument matching. Also, overloaded operators, rules for operator overloading.  
  
 [Exception Handling](../VS_csharp/exception-handling-in-visual-c--.md)  
 C++ exception handling, structured exception handling (SEH), keywords used in writing exception handling statements.  
  
 [Assertion and User-Supplied Messages](../VS_csharp/assertion-and-user-supplied-messages--c---.md)  
 `#error` directive, the `static_assert` keyword, the `assert` macro.  
  
 [Templates](../VS_csharp/templates--c---.md)  
 Template specifications, function templates, class templates, typename keyword, templates vs. macros, templates and smart pointers.  
  
 [Event Handling](../VS_csharp/event-handling.md)  
 Declaring events and event handlers.  
  
 [Microsoft-Specific Modifiers](../VS_csharp/microsoft-specific-modifiers.md)  
 Modifiers specific to Microsoft C++. Memory addressing, calling conventions, naked functions, extended storage-class attributes (__declspec), \__w64.  
  
 [Inline Assembler](../VS_csharp/inline-assembler.md)  
 Using assembly language and C++ in __asm blocks.  
  
 [Compiler COM Support](../VS_csharp/compiler-com-support.md)  
 A reference to Microsoft-specific classes and global functions used to support COM types.  
  
 [Microsoft Extensions](../VS_csharp/microsoft-extensions.md)  
 Microsoft extensions to C++.  
  
 [Nonstandard Behavior](../VS_csharp/nonstandard-behavior.md)  
 Information about nonstandard behavior of the Visual C++ compiler.
