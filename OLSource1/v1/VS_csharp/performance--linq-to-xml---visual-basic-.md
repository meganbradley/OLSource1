# Performance (LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)
This section provides information about performance in [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../VS_csharp/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)], specifically the performance of functional construction and queries.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Performance of Chained Queries (LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)](../VS_csharp/performance-of-chained-queries--linq-to-xml---visual-basic-.md)  
 Provides performance information about chained [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../VS_csharp/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)] queries.  
  
 [Atomized XName and XNamespace Objects (LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)](../VS_csharp/atomized-xname-and-xnamespace-objects--linq-to-xml---visual-basic-.md)  
 Provides performance information about the atomization of <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XName*> and <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XNamespace*> objects.  
  
 [Pre-Atomization of XName Objects (LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)](../VS_csharp/pre-atomization-of-xname-objects--linq-to-xml---visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes a technique to pre-atomize <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XName*> and <xref:System.Xml.Linq.XNamespace*> objects. This can significantly improve performance in some scenarios.  
  
 [Statically Compiled Queries (LINQ to XML) (Visual Basic)](../VS_csharp/statically-compiled-queries--linq-to-xml---visual-basic-.md)  
 Provides performance information about statically compiled queries, in contrast to the parsing and processing that must be done by an XPath expression evaluator.
