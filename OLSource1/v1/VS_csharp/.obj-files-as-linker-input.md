# .Obj Files as Linker Input
The linker tool (LINK.EXE) accepts .obj files that are in Common Object File Format (COFF).  
  
## Remarks  
 Microsoft provides a downloadable document that defines the common object file format. For more information, download revision 8.1 or later of the [Microsoft Portable Executable and Common Object File Format Specification](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=93292).  
  
## Unicode Support  
 Starting with Visual Studio 2005, the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler supports Unicode characters in identifiers as defined by the ISO/IEC C and C++ standards. Previous versions of the compiler supported only ASCII characters in identifiers. To support Unicode in the names of functions, classes, and statics, the compiler and linker use the Unicode UTF-8 encoding for COFF symbols in .obj files. The UTF-8 encoding is upwardly compatible with the ASCII encoding used by earlier versions of Visual Studio.  
  
 For more information about the compiler and linker, see [Unicode Support in the Compiler and Linker](../VS_csharp/unicode-support-in-the-compiler-and-linker.md). For more information about the Unicode standard, see the [Unicode](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=37123) organization.
