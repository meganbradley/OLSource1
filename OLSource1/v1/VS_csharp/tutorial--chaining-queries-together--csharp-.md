# Tutorial: Chaining Queries Together (C#)
This tutorial illustrates the processing model when you chain queries together. Chaining queries together is a key part of writing functional transformations. It is important to understand exactly how chained queries work.  
  
 The queries that process Office Open XML documents use this technique extensively.
