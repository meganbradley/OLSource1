# How the Framework Calls a Handler
The following topics first examine how the framework routes commands, then examine how other messages and control notifications are sent to windows:  
  
-   [Message sending and receiving](../VS_csharp/message-sending-and-receiving.md)  
  
-   [How noncommand messages reach their handlers](../VS_csharp/how-noncommand-messages-reach-their-handlers.md)  
  
-   [Command routing](../VS_csharp/command-routing.md)  
  
-   [Command Routing Illustration](../VS_csharp/command-routing-illustration.md)  
  
-   [The OnCmdMsg Handler](../VS_csharp/oncmdmsg-handler.md)  
  
-   [Overriding the Standard Command Routing](../VS_csharp/overriding-the-standard-command-routing.md)
