## In This Section  
 [Accessing Computer Resources](../VS_csharp/accessing-computer-resources--visual-basic-.md)  
 Contains documentation on how to use the `My.Computer` object to access information about the computer on which an application runs and how to control the computer.  
  
 [Logging Information from the Application](../VS_csharp/logging-information-from-the-application--visual-basic-.md)  
 Contains documentation on how to log information from your application using the `My.Application.Log` and `My.Log` objects, and how to extend the application's logging capabilities.  
  
 [Accessing User Data](../VS_csharp/accessing-user-data--visual-basic-.md)  
 Contains documentation on tasks that you can accomplish using the `My.User` object.  
  
 [Accessing Application Forms](../VS_csharp/accessing-application-forms--visual-basic-.md)  
 Contains documentation on accessing an application's forms by using the `My.Forms` and `My.Application` objects.  
  
 [Accessing Application Web Services](../VS_csharp/accessing-application-web-services--visual-basic-.md)  
 Contains documentation on how to access the Web services referenced by the application using the `My.WebServices` object.  
  
 [Accessing Application Settings](../VS_csharp/accessing-application-settings--visual-basic-.md)  
 Contains documentation on accessing an application's settings using the `My.Settings` object.  
  
 [Processing Drives, Directories, and Files](../VS_csharp/processing-drives--directories--and-files--visual-basic-.md)
