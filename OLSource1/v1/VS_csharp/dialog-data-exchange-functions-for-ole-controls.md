# Dialog Data Exchange Functions for OLE Controls
This topic lists the DDX_OC functions used to exchange data between a property of an OLE control in a dialog box, form view, or control view object and a data member of the dialog box, form view, or control view object.  
  
### DDX_OC Functions  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|[DDX_OCBool](../VS_csharp/ddx_ocbool.md)|Manages the transfer of **BOOL** data between a property of an OLE control and a **BOOL** data member.|  
|[DDX_OCBoolRO](../VS_csharp/ddx_ocboolro.md)|Manages the transfer of **BOOL** data between a read-only property of an OLE control and a **BOOL** data member.|  
|[DDX_OCColor](../VS_csharp/ddx_occolor.md)|Manages the transfer of **OLE_COLOR** data between a property of an OLE control and an **OLE_COLOR** data member.|  
|[DDX_OCColorRO](../VS_csharp/ddx_occolorro.md)|Manages the transfer of **OLE_COLOR** data between a read-only property of an OLE control and an **OLE_COLOR** data member.|  
|[DDX_OCFloat](../VS_csharp/ddx_ocfloat.md)|Manages the transfer of **float** (or **double**) data between a property of an OLE control and a **float** (or **double**) data member.|  
|[DDX_OCFloatRO](../VS_csharp/ddx_ocfloatro.md)|Manages the transfer of **float** (or **double**) data between a read-only property of an OLE control and a **float** (or **double**) data member.|  
|[DDX_OCInt](../VS_csharp/ddx_ocint.md)|Manages the transfer of `int` (or **long**) data between a property of an OLE control and an `int` (or **long**) data member.|  
|[DDX_OCIntRO](../VS_csharp/ddx_ocintro.md)|Manages the transfer of `int` (or **long**) data between a read-only property of an OLE control and an `int` (or **long**) data member.|  
|[DDX_OCShort](../VS_csharp/ddx_ocshort.md)|Manages the transfer of **short** data between a property of an OLE control and a **short** data member.|  
|[DDX_OCShortRO](../VS_csharp/ddx_ocshortro.md)|Manages the transfer of **short** data between a read-only property of an OLE control and a **short** data member.|  
|[DDX_OCText](../VS_csharp/ddx_octext.md)|Manages the transfer of **CString** data between a property of an OLE control and a **CString** data member.|  
|[DDX_OCTextRO](../VS_csharp/ddx_octextro.md)|Manages the transfer of **CString** data between a read-only property of an OLE control and a **CString** data member.|
