# C#
C# (pronounced "C sharp") is a programming language that is designed for building a variety of applications that run on the .NET Framework. C# is simple, powerful, type-safe, and object-oriented. The many innovations in C# enable rapid application development while retaining the expressiveness and elegance of C-style languages.  
  
 If you don't already have C#, you can acquire a version of Visual Studio that includes C# for free from the [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/free-developer-offers-vs) site.
