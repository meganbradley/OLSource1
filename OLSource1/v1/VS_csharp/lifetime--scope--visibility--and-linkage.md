# Lifetime, Scope, Visibility, and Linkage
To understand how a C program works, you must understand the rules that determine how variables and functions can be used in the program. Several concepts are crucial to understanding these rules:  
  
-   [Lifetime](../VS_csharp/lifetime.md)  
  
-   [Scope and visibility](../VS_csharp/scope-and-visibility.md)  
  
-   [Linkage](../VS_csharp/linkage.md)
