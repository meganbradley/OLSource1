# OLE Classes
The OLE classes work with the other application framework classes to provide easy access to the ActiveX API, giving your programs an easy way to provide the power of ActiveX to your users. Using ActiveX, you can:  
  
-   Create compound documents, which allow users to create and edit documents containing data created by multiple applications, including text, graphics, spreadsheets, sound, or other types of data.  
  
-   Create OLE objects that can be embedded in compound documents.  
  
-   Use OLE drag and drop to copy data between applications.  
  
-   Use Automation to control one program with another.  
  
-   Create ActiveX controls and ActiveX control containers (formerly called OLE controls and OLE control containers, respectively).  
  
 The following categories of classes support ActiveX:  
  
-   [OLE Container Classes](../VS_csharp/ole-container-classes.md)  
  
-   [OLE Server Classes](../VS_csharp/ole-server-classes.md)  
  
-   [OLE Drag-and-Drop and Data Transfer Classes](../VS_csharp/ole-drag-and-drop-and-data-transfer-classes.md)  
  
-   [OLE Common Dialog Classes](../VS_csharp/ole-common-dialog-classes.md)  
  
-   [OLE Automation Classes](../VS_csharp/ole-automation-classes.md)  
  
-   [OLE Control Classes](../VS_csharp/ole-control-classes.md)  
  
-   [Active Document Classes](../VS_csharp/active-document-classes.md)  
  
-   [OLE-Related Classes](../VS_csharp/ole-related-classes.md)  
  
 To see the inheritance of a class, use the [Class Hierarchy Chart](../VS_csharp/hierarchy-chart.md).
