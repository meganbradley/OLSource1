# C28312
warning 28312: The <annotation_name> annotation on the repeated declaration of <function\> <parameter\> is an obsolescent version of SAL.  
  
 The annotation is an old version and should be updated to the equivalent [SAL2](../VS_csharp/using-sal-annotations-to-reduce-c-c---code-defects.md). This warning is not emitted if a prior inconsistent annotation warning has been emitted, and is reported only once per declaration. Inspect the rest of the declaration for more obsolete SAL.
