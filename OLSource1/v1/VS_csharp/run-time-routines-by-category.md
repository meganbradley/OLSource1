# Run-Time Routines by Category
This section lists and describes Microsoft run-time library routines by category. For reference convenience, some routines are listed in more than one category. Multibyte-character routines and wide-character routines are grouped with single-byte â€“ character counterparts, where they exist.  
  
 This section also provides .NET Framework equivalent methods or classes where available.  
  
 The main categories of Microsoft run-time library routines are:
