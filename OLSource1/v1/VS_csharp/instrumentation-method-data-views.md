# Instrumentation Method Data Views
This section contains reference information for the views and reports of profiler data files that were generated by using the instrumentation method.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Summary View - Profiler Instrumentation Data](../VS_csharp/summary-view---instrumentation-data.md)  
 Lists the functions that consumed the most time and the functions that did the most individual work.  
  
 [Call Tree View - Profiler Instrumentation Data](../VS_csharp/call-tree-view---instrumentation-data.md)  
 Displays the execution paths of functions in a hierarchical tree.  
  
 [Modules View - Profiler Instrumentation Data](../VS_csharp/modules-view---instrumentation-data.md)  
 Organizes profiling data by module, and lists profiling data for the functions in the module.  
  
 [Caller / Callee View - Profiler Instrumentation Data](../VS_csharp/caller-callee-view---instrumentation-data.md)  
 Displays profiling data for the parent and child functions of a selected function.  
  
 [Functions View - Profiler Instrumentation Data](../VS_csharp/functions-view---instrumentation-data.md)  
 Lists profiling data by function.  
  
## Reference  
 [Function Details View](../VS_csharp/function-details-view.md)  
 Displays a graphical chart of the relationship between a selected function and the functions that called and were called by the selected function.  
  
 [Process View](../VS_csharp/process-view.md)  
 Lists process start, end, and lifetime time for all processes that wer profiled.
