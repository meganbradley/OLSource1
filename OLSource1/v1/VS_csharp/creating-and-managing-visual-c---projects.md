# Creating and Managing Visual C++ Projects
You can create Visual C++ projects by choosing **File &#124; New &#124; Project**, ensuring that Visual C++ is selected in the left pane, and then choosing from the list of project templates in the middle pane. When you click on a template, in many cases a wizard will appear that enables you to set various project properties before the project is created. You can view and modify those properties later by using the project's property pages (**Project &#124; Properties**).  
  
 You can also create new projects by:  
  
-   choosing **File &#124; New &#124; Project from Existing Code** and following the prompts to add existing source code files. This option works best for relatively small and simple projects, perhaps 25 source codes files or less with few or no complex dependencies.  
  
-   starting with a makefile and choose the Makefile Project template under the General tab.  
  
-   creating an empty project (under the **General** tab) and manually adding source code files by right-clicking on the project node in solution explorer and choosing **Add &#124; Existing Item**.  
  
-   using the [Win32 Application Wizard](../VS_csharp/win32-application-wizard.md).
