# lock Statement (C# Reference)
The `lock` keyword marks a statement block as a critical section by obtaining the mutual-exclusion lock for a given object, executing a statement, and then releasing the lock. The following example includes a `lock` statement.  
  
```  
  
class Account  
{  
    decimal balance;  
    private Object thisLock = new Object();  
  
    public void Withdraw(decimal amount)  
    {  
        lock (thisLock)  
        {  
            if (amount > balance)  
            {  
                throw new Exception("Insufficient funds");  
            }  
            balance -= amount;  
        }  
    }  
}  
  
```  
  
 For more information, see [Thread Synchronization](../Topic/Thread%20Synchronization%20\(C%23%20and%20Visual%20Basic\).md).  
  
## Remarks  
 The `lock` keyword ensures that one thread does not enter a critical section of code while another thread is in the critical section. If another thread tries to enter a locked code, it will wait, block, until the object is released.  
  
 The section [Threading](../Topic/Threading%20\(C%23%20and%20Visual%20Basic\).md) discusses threading.  
  
 The `lock` keyword calls \<xref:System.Threading.Monitor.Enter*> at the start of the block and \<xref:System.Threading.Monitor.Exit*> at the end of the block. A \<xref:System.Threading.ThreadInterruptedException> is thrown if \<xref:System.Threading.Thread.Interrupt*> interrupts a thread that is waiting to enter a `lock` statement.  
  
 In general, avoid locking on a `public` type, or instances beyond your code's control. The common constructs `lock (this)`, `lock (typeof (MyType))`, and `lock ("myLock")` violate this guideline:  
  
-   `lock (this)` is a problem if the instance can be accessed publicly.  
  
-   `lock (typeof (MyType))` is a problem if `MyType` is publicly accessible.  
  
-   `lock("myLock")` is a problem because any other code in the process using the same string, will share the same lock.  
  
 Best practice is to define a `private` object to lock on, or a `private static` object variable to protect data common to all instances.  
  
 You can't use the [await](../VS_csharp/await--csharp-reference-.md) keyword in the body of a `lock` statement.  
  
## Example  
 The following sample shows a simple use of threads without locking in C#.  
  
 [!code[csrefKeywordsFixedLock#5](../VS_csharp/codesnippet/CSharp/lock-statement--csharp-reference-_1.cs)]  
  
## Example  
 The following sample uses threads and `lock`. As long as the `lock` statement is present, the statement block is a critical section and `balance` will never become a negative number.
