# Managing Settings in LightSwitch
You manage several categories of settings in Visual Studio LightSwitch in several locations.  
  
 Global settings affect the development environment, such as the font size to display in the **Code Editor** or the number of items to show in a recently used list. You manage these settings in the **Options** dialog box, which you access by, on the menu bar, choosing **Tools**, **Options**.  
  
 Application settings affect only the application that you're working in. You manage these settings in the **Application Designer**, which you access from the shortcut menu for the **Properties** node in **Solution Explorer**.  
  
 The **Application Designer** is divided into several tabs:  
  
-   The **General Properties** tab contains miscellaneous settings such as the **Application version** and the **Default Language** properties.  
  
-   The **Extensions** tab contains settings to manage any extensions that you've installed.  
  
-   The **Access Control** tab manages settings for authentication and authorization.  
  
-   The **SharePoint** tab contains settings for debugging your application and deploying it to SharePoint.
