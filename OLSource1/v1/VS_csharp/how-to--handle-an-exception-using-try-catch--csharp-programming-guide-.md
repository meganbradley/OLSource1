# How to: Handle an Exception Using try-catch (C# Programming Guide)
The purpose of a [try-catch](../VS_csharp/try-catch--csharp-reference-.md) block is to catch and handle an exception generated by working code. Some exceptions can be handled in a `catch` block and the problem solved without the exception being re-thrown; however, more often the only thing that you can do is make sure that the appropriate exception is thrown.  
  
## Example  
 In this example, \<xref:System.IndexOutOfRangeException> is not the most appropriate exception: \<xref:System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException> makes more sense for the method because the error is caused by the `index` argument passed in by the caller.  
  
 [!code[csProgGuideExceptions#5](../VS_csharp/codesnippet/CSharp/how-to--handle-an-exception-using-try-catch--csharp-programming-guide-_1.cs)]  
  
## Comments  
 The code that causes an exception is enclosed in the `try` block. A `catch` statement is added immediately after to handle `IndexOutOfRangeException`, if it occurs. The `catch` block handles the `IndexOutOfRangeException` and throws the more appropriate `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` exception instead. In order to provide the caller with as much information as possible, consider specifying the original exception as the \<xref:System.Exception.InnerException*> of the new exception. Because the \<xref:System.Exception.InnerException*> property is [readonly](../VS_csharp/readonly--csharp-reference-.md), you must assign it in the constructor of the new exception.
