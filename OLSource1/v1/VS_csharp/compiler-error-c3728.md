# Compiler Error C3728
'event': event does not have a raise method  
  
 Metadata created with a language, such as C#, that does not allow an event to be raised from outside the class in which it was defined, was included with the [#using](../VS_csharp/sharpusing-directive--c---.md) directive, and a Visual C++ program using CLR programming attempted to raise the event.  
  
 To raise an event in a program developed in a language such as C#, the class containing the event needs to also define a public method that raises the event.
