# Makefile Project Wizard
Use this wizard to create a command line for the build engine to execute. Once you create the project, you can view and edit the project's properties in the project's [property page](../VS_csharp/working-with-project-properties.md).  
  
## Overview  
 This wizard page describes the current project settings for the project you are creating. By default, the project is set up to build both debug and release configurations of *ProjName*.exe.  
  
 To change these defaults, click the [Application Settings](../VS_csharp/application-settings--makefile-project-wizard.md) tab in the left column of the wizard and make the desired changes.
