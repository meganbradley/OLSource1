# Dual Interfaces and ATL
A dual interface allows its methods to be accessed as dispinterface methods or as vtable methods. This section covers some of the features of dual interfaces from an ATL perspective.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Implementing a Dual Interface](../VS_csharp/implementing-a-dual-interface.md)  
 Discusses the classes and wizards involved in implementing a dual interface.  
  
 [Multiple Dual Interfaces](../VS_csharp/multiple-dual-interfaces.md)  
 Discusses how to expose multiple dual interfaces on a single object.  
  
 [The nonextensible Attribute](../VS_csharp/nonextensible-attribute.md)  
 Discusses when to use the **nonextensible** attribute on your interface definition.  
  
 [Dual Interfaces and Events](../VS_csharp/dual-interfaces-and-events.md)  
 Discusses design reasons for not making an event interface a dual interface.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [ATL](../VS_csharp/active-template-library--atl--concepts.md)  
 Provides links to conceptual topics on how to program using the Active Template Library.
