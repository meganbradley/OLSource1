# Selecting Multiple Controls
### To select multiple controls  
  
1.  In the [Toolbox Window](../VS_csharp/toolbox.md), select the **Pointer** tool.  
  
2.  Drag the pointer to draw a selection box around the controls you want to select in your dialog box.  
  
     When you release the mouse button, all controls inside and intersecting the selection box are selected.  
  
     \- or -  
  
-   Hold down the SHIFT key and click the controls you'd like to include in the selection.  
  
     \- or -  
  
-   Hold down the Ctrl key and click the controls you'd like to include in the selection.  
  
#### To remove a control from a group of selected controls or to add a control to a group of selected controls  
  
1.  With a group of controls selected, hold down the SHIFT key and click the control you want to remove from or add to the existing selection.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Holding down the CTRL key and clicking a control within a selection will make that control the dominant control in that selection. For more information, see [Specifying the Dominant Control](../VS_csharp/specifying-the-dominant-control.md).
