# Class Factories Classes
The following classes implement or support a class factory:  
  
-   [CComClassFactory](../VS_csharp/ccomclassfactory-class.md) Provides a default class factory for object creation.  
  
-   [CComClassFactory2](../VS_csharp/ccomclassfactory2-class.md) Controls object creation through a license.  
  
-   [CComClassFactoryAutoThread](../VS_csharp/ccomclassfactoryautothread-class.md) Allows objects to be created in multiple thread-pooled apartments.  
  
-   [CComClassFactorySingleton](../VS_csharp/ccomclassfactorysingleton-class.md) Creates a single object.  
  
-   [CComCoClass](../VS_csharp/ccomcoclass-class.md) Defines the class factory for the object.
