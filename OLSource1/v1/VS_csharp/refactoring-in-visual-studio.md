# Refactoring in Visual Studio
Refactoring is the process of modifying code in order to make it easier to maintain, understand, and extend, but without changing its behavior. Some common *refactorings* include:  
  
1.  splitting long functions into smaller ones  
  
2.  renaming variables, types, functions or parameters  
  
3.  reordering parameters  
  
4.  removing or reordering using directives  
  
 Because the logic of refactoring is closely tied to language syntax, each language service in Visual Studio provides its own refactoring capabilities. For more information, see the following pages:  
  
### Refactoring in C#  
 [Refactoring (C#)](../VS_csharp/refactoring--csharp-.md)  
  
### Refactoring in Visual Basic

### Refactoring in C++  
 [Writing and refactoring code (C++)](../VS_csharp/writing-and-refactoring-code--c---.md)  
  
### Refactoring in F#  
 Refactoring support for F# is provided in [Visual F# Power Tools](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/136b942e-9f2c-4c0b-8bac-86d774189cff), a third-party Visual Studio extension.
