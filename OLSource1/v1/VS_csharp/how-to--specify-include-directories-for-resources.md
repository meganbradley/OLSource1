# How to: Specify Include Directories for Resources
### To specify include directories for a specific .rc file  
  
1.  Right-click the .rc file in Solution Explorer and select **Properties** from the shortcut menu.  
  
2.  In the **Property Pages** dialog box, click the **Resources** node in the left pane, then specify the additional include directories in the **Additional include directories** property.  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](assetId:///8ad495d4-2941-40cf-bf64-e82e85825890) in the .NET Framework Developer's Guide. For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](assetId:///bb4e5b44-e2b0-48ab-bbe9-609fb33900b6).
