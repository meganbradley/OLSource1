# Data Transfer Classes
The following classes support various types of data transfer:  
  
-   [IDataObjectImpl](../VS_csharp/idataobjectimpl-class.md) Supports Uniform Data Transfer by using standard formats to retrieve and set data. Handles data change notifications by managing connections to advise sinks.  
  
-   [CBindStatusCallback](../VS_csharp/cbindstatuscallback-class.md) Allows an asynchronous moniker to send and receive information about the asynchronous data transfer to and from your object.
