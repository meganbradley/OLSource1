# Accessing Computer Resources (Visual Basic)
The `My.Computer` object is one of the three central objects in `My`, providing access to information and commonly used functionality. `My.Computer` provides methods, properties, and events for accessing the computer on which the application is running. Its objects include:  
  
-   <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Audio*>  
  
-   Clipboard (<xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.MyServices.ClipboardProxy*>)  
  
-   <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Clock*>  
  
-   <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.FileSystem*>  
  
-   <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.ServerComputer.Info*>  
  
-   <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Keyboard*>  
  
-   <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Mouse*>  
  
-   <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Network*>  
  
-   <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Devices.Ports*>  
  
-   Registry (<xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.MyServices.RegistryProxy*>)
