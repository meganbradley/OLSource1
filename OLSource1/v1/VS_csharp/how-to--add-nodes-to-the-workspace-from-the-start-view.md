# How to: Add Nodes to the Workspace from the Start View
This topic describes how to add global nodes to the [workspace](../VS_csharp/xml-schema-designer-workspace.md) from the [Start View](../VS_csharp/start-view.md).  
  
### To add nodes to the workspace from the Start View  
  
1.  Follow the steps in [How to: Create and Edit an XSD Schema File](../VS_csharp/how-to--create-and-edit-an-xsd-schema-file.md).  
  
2.  Right-click in the XML Editor and select **View Designer**.  
  
     The Start View appears.  
  
     In the **Schema Set Details** section, notice that there are two (**2**) **Global Complex Types**.  
  
3.  Click on the **add** link to the right of the **Global Complex Types** heading.  
  
     The `USAddress` and `PurchaseOrderType` complex type nodes will appear on the design surface of the Graph View.
