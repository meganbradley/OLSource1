# Programming Guide (LINQ to XML) (C#)
This section provides conceptual and how-to information about programming with [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../VS_csharp/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)].  
  
## Who Should Read This Documentation  
 This documentation targets developers who already understand C# and some basic aspects of the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../VS_csharp/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)].  
  
 The goal of this documentation is to make [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../VS_csharp/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)] easy to use for all kinds of developers. [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../VS_csharp/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)] makes XML programming easier. You do not have to be an expert developer to use it.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../VS_csharp/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)] relies heavily on generic classes. Therefore, is very important that you understand the use of generic classes. Further, it is helpful if you are familiar with delegates that are declared as parameterized types. If you are not familiar with C# generic classes, see [Generic Classes](../VS_csharp/generic-classes--csharp-programming-guide-.md).  
  
## In This Section  
  
|Topic|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[LINQ to XML Programming Overview (C#)](../VS_csharp/linq-to-xml-programming-overview--csharp-.md)|Provides an overview of the [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../VS_csharp/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)] classes, and detailed information about three of the most important classes: \<xref:System.Xml.Linq.XElement>, \<xref:System.Xml.Linq.XAttribute>, and \<xref:System.Xml.Linq.XDocument>.|  
|[Creating XML Trees (C#)](../VS_csharp/creating-xml-trees--csharp-.md)|Provides conceptual and task-based information about creating XML trees. You can create XML trees by using functional construction, or by parsing XML text from a string or a file. You can also use an \<xref:System.Xml.XmlReader> to populate an XML tree.|  
|[Working with XML Namespaces (C#)](../VS_csharp/working-with-xml-namespaces--csharp-.md)|Provides detailed information about creating XML trees that use namespaces.|  
|[Serializing XML Trees (C#)](../VS_csharp/serializing-xml-trees--csharp-.md)|Describes multiple approaches to serializing an XML tree, and gives guidance on which approach to use.|  
|[LINQ to XML Axes (C#)](../VS_csharp/linq-to-xml-axes--csharp-.md)|Enumerates and describes the [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../VS_csharp/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)] axis methods, which you must understand before you can write [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../VS_csharp/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)] queries.|  
|[Querying XML Trees (C#)](../VS_csharp/querying-xml-trees--csharp-.md)|Provides common examples of querying XML trees.|  
|[Modifying XML Trees (LINQ to XML) (C#)](../VS_csharp/modifying-xml-trees--linq-to-xml---csharp-.md)|Like the Document Object Model (DOM), [!INCLUDE[sqltecxlinq](../VS_csharp/includes/sqltecxlinq_md.md)] enables you to modify an XML tree in place.|  
|[Advanced LINQ to XML Programming (C#)](../VS_csharp/advanced-linq-to-xml-programming--csharp-.md)|Provides information about annotations, events, streaming, and other advanced scenarios.|  
|[LINQ to XML Security (C#)](../VS_csharp/linq-to-xml-security--csharp-.md)|Describes security issues associated with LINQ to XML and provides some guidance for mitigating security exposure.|  
|[Sample XML Documents (LINQ to XML)](../VS_csharp/sample-xml-documents--linq-to-xml-2.md)|Contains the sample XML documents that are used by many examples in this documentation.|
