# Configuring Usage Rights for Azure Rights Management
When you set protection on files or emails by using Azure Rights Management (Azure RMS) and you do not use a template, you must configure the usage rights yourself. In addition, when you configure custom templates for Azure RMS, you select the usage rights that will then be automatically applied when the template is selected by users, administrators, or configured services. For example, in the Azure  portal you can select roles that configure a logical grouping of usage rights, or you can configure the individual rights.

Use this topic to help you configure the usage rights you want for the application you’re using and understand how these rights are interpreted by applications.

## Usage Rights and Descriptions
The following table lists and describes the usage rights that Rights Management supports, and how they are used and interpreted. In this table, the **Common name** is typically how you might see the usage right displayed or referenced, as a more friendly version of the single-word value that is used in the code (the **Encoding in policy** value). The **API Constant or Value** is the SDK name for an MSIPC API call, used when you write an RMS-enlightened application that checks for a usage right, or adds a usage right to a policy.
