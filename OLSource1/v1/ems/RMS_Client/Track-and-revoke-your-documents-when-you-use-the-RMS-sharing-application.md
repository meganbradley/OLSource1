# Track and revoke your documents when you use the RMS sharing application
After you have protected your documents by using the RMS sharing application, you can track how people are using your protected documents, and if necessary, revoke access to them when you want to stop sharing. To do this, you use the document tracking site, which you can access from Windows computers, Mac computers, and even from tablets and phones.

> [!TIP]
> Two minute video: [Azure RMS Document Tracking and Revocation](http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Information-Protection/Azure-RMS-Document-Tracking-and-Revocation)

When you access this site, you just need to sign in to track your documents. Then, you can see who tried to open the files that you protected and whether they were successful (they were successfully authenticated) or not. Each time they tried to access the document, and their location at the time. In addition:

-   If you need to stop sharing a document: Click **Revoke access**, note the period of time that the document will continue to be available, and decide whether to let people know that you’re revoking access to the document you previously shared, and provide a customized message.

-   If you want to export to Excel: Click **Open in Excel**, so that you can then modify the data, and create your own views and graphs.

-   If you want to configure email notifications: Click **Settings** and select how and whether to be emailed when the document is accessed.

-   If you have questions or want to provide feedback about the document tracking site: Click the Help icon to access the [FAQ for Document Tracking](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523977).

## Using Office to access the document tracking site

-   For the Office applications, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint: On the **Home** tab, in the **RMS** group, click **Share Protected**, and then click **Track Usage**.

    ![Track usage from Office applications when using the RMS sharing application](../../ems/RMS_Client/media/ADRMS_MSRMSApp_OfficeToolbarTrackUsage.png "ADRMS_MSRMSApp_OfficeToolbarTrackUsage")

-   For Outlook: On the **Home** tab, in the  **RMS** group, click **Track Usage**:

    ![Select Track Usage from Outlook when using the RMS sharing application](../../ems/RMS_Client/media/ADRMS_MSRMSApp_OutlookTrackUsage.png "ADRMS_MSRMSApp_OutlookTrackUsage")

If you do not see these options for RMS, it’s likely that either the RMS sharing application is not installed on your computer, the latest version isn’t installed, or your computer must be restarted to complete the installation. For more information about how to install the sharing application, see [Download and install the Rights Management sharing application](../../ems/RMS_Client/Download-and-install-the-Rights-Management-sharing-application.md).
