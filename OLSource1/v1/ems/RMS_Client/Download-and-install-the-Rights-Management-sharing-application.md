# Download and install the Rights Management sharing application
You must have a local administrator account to install the RMS sharing application. If you do not log in as a local administrator, you can use the **Run as administrator** option when you run Setup.exe in step 3.

### To download and install the Rights Management sharing application

1.  Go to the [Microsoft Rights Management](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=303970) page on the Microsoft website.

2.  In the **Computers** section, click the icon for the **RMS app for Windows** and save the **Setup.exe** file to install Microsoft Rights Management sharing application.

3.  Double-click the Setup.exe file that was downloaded. If you are prompted to continue, click **Yes**.

4.  On the **Setup Microsoft RMS** page, click **Next**, and wait for the installation to finish.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The RMS sharing application requires the Microsoft .NET Framework, minimum version 4.0. Setup checks to see whether this is installed and if it is not, you will see a message with a link to install it.

5.  When the installation finishes, click **Restart** to restart your computer and complete the installation. Or, click **Close** and restart your computer later to complete the installation.

Youâ€™re now ready to start protecting your files or read files that others have protected.
