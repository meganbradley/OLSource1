# File Access with Visual Basic
The `My.Computer.FileSystem` object provides tools for working with files and folders. Its properties, methods, and events allow you to create, copy, move, investigate, and delete files and folders. `My.Computer.FileSystem` provides better performance than the legacy functions (`FileOpen`, `FileClose`, `Input`, `InputString`, `LineInput`, etc.) that are provided by [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../VS_visualbasic/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] for backward compatibility.
