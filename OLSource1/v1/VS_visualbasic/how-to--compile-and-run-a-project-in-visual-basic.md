# How to: Compile and Run a Project in Visual Basic
The [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../VS_visualbasic/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Integrated Development Environment (IDE) makes it easy to compile a project and run the resulting application.  
  
 You can use the debugger built into the IDE to debug your project as it runs. For more information about debugging, see [Debugging Your Visual Basic Application](../VS_visualbasic/debugging-your-visual-basic-application.md) and [Edit and Continue (Visual Basic)](../Topic/Edit%20and%20Continue%20\(Visual%20Basic\).md).  
  
 [!INCLUDE[note_settings_general](../VS_visualbasic/includes/note_settings_general_md.md)]  
  
### To compile and run the current project  
  
-   Press F5 while you are in the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../VS_visualbasic/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Integrated Development Environment (IDE).  
  
     The IDE compiles the project and runs the application within the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../VS_visualbasic/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] debugger.  
  
### To compile and run the current project from the menu  
  
-   From the **Debug** menu of the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../VS_visualbasic/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] IDE, choose **Start Debugging**.  
  
     The IDE compiles the project and runs the application within the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../VS_visualbasic/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] debugger.  
  
### To compile and run the current project without debugging  
  
-   Press CTRL+F5 in the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../VS_visualbasic/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] IDE.  
  
     The IDE compiles the project and runs the application.  
  
 For information about compiling and running [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../VS_visualbasic/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] code using the command-line compiler, see [Building from the Command Line](../VS_visualbasic/building-from-the-command-line--visual-basic-.md).
