# Getting Started with LINQ in Visual Basic
This section contains overviews, examples, and background information that will help you understand and use Visual Basic and Language-Integrated Query (LINQ).  
  
## In This Section  
 [Writing Your First LINQ Query](../VS_visualbasic/writing-your-first-linq-query--visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes the three stages in writing a basic LINQ query: obtaining the data source, writing the query, and executing the query.  
  
 [Basic Query Operations (Visual Basic)](../VS_visualbasic/basic-query-operations--visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes the most common types of query operations and how they are expressed in Visual Basic.  
  
 [Visual Basic Features That Support LINQ](../VS_visualbasic/visual-basic-features-that-support-linq.md)  
 Describes the Visual Basic language features that support LINQ, such as anonymous types and type inference.  
  
 [Type Relationships in Query Operations (Visual Basic)](../VS_visualbasic/type-relationships-in-query-operations--visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes how data types are preserved or transformed when queries are written and executed.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Writing Queries in Visual Basic](../VS_visualbasic/walkthrough--writing-queries-in-visual-basic.md)  
 Step-by-step instructions for creating a Visual Basic LINQ project, adding a simple data source, and performing some basic query operations.
