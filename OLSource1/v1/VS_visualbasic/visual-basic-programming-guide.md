# Visual Basic Programming Guide
As with any modern programming language, [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../VS_visualbasic/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] supports many common programming constructs and language elements. This guide describes all the major elements of programming with [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../VS_visualbasic/includes/vbprvb_md.md)].  
  
## In This Section  
 [Program Structure and Code Conventions](../VS_visualbasic/program-structure-and-code-conventions--visual-basic-.md)  
 Contains documentation on the basic structure and code conventions of [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../VS_visualbasic/includes/vbprvb_md.md)], such as naming conventions, comments in code, and limitations within [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../VS_visualbasic/includes/vbprvb_md.md)].  
  
 [Visual Basic Language Features](../VS_visualbasic/visual-basic-language-features.md)  
 Provides links to topics that introduce and discuss important features of [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../VS_visualbasic/includes/vbprvb_md.md)], including LINQ and XML literals.  
  
 [COM Interop](../VS_visualbasic/com-interop--visual-basic-.md)  
 Explains the interoperability issues associated with creating and using component object model (COM) objects with [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../VS_visualbasic/includes/vbprvb_md.md)].  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Visual Basic Language Reference](../VS_visualbasic/visual-basic-language-reference.md)  
 Provides reference information about various aspects of [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../VS_visualbasic/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] programming.  
  
 [Visual Basic Command-Line Compiler](../VS_visualbasic/visual-basic-command-line-compiler.md)  
 Offers information on using the [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../VS_visualbasic/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] command-line compiler, the compiler options, and the Keyword Upgrade tool.
