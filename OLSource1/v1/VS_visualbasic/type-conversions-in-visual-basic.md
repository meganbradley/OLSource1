# Type Conversions in Visual Basic
The process of changing a value from one data type to another type is called *conversion*. Conversions are either *widening* or *narrowing*, depending on the data capacities of the types involved. They are also *implicit* or *explicit*, depending on the syntax in the source code.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Widening and Narrowing Conversions](../VS_csharp/widening-and-narrowing-conversions--visual-basic-.md)  
 Explains conversions classified by whether the destination type can hold the data.  
  
 [Implicit and Explicit Conversions](../VS_csharp/implicit-and-explicit-conversions--visual-basic-.md)  
 Discusses conversions classified by whether [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../VS_csharp/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] performs them automatically.  
  
 [Conversions Between Strings and Other Types](../VS_csharp/conversions-between-strings-and-other-types--visual-basic-.md)  
 Illustrates converting between strings and numeric, `Boolean`, or date/time values.  
  
 [How to: Convert an Object to Another Type (Visual Basic)](../VS_csharp/how-to--convert-an-object-to-another-type-in-visual-basic.md)  
 Shows how to convert an `Object` variable to any other data type.  
  
 [Array Conversions](../VS_csharp/array-conversions--visual-basic-.md)  
 Steps you through the process of converting between arrays of different data types.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Data Types](../VS_csharp/data-types-in-visual-basic.md)  
 Introduces the [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../VS_csharp/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] data types and describes how to use them.  
  
 [Data Types](../VS_csharp/data-type-summary--visual-basic-.md)  
 Lists the elementary data types supplied by [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../VS_csharp/includes/vbprvb_md.md)].  
  
 [Troubleshooting Data Types](../VS_csharp/troubleshooting-data-types--visual-basic-.md)  
 Discusses some common problems that can arise when working with data types.
