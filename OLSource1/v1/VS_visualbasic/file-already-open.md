# File already open
Sometimes a file must be closed before another `FileOpen` or other operation can occur. Among the possible causes of this error are:  
  
-   A sequential output mode `FileOpen` operation was executed for a file that is already open  
  
-   A statement refers to an open file.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Close the file before executing the statement.
