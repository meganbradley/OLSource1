# Program Structure and Code Conventions (Visual Basic)
This section introduces the typical [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../VS_csharp/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] program structure, provides a simple [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../VS_csharp/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] program, "Hello, World", and discusses [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../VS_csharp/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] code conventions. Code conventions are suggestions that focus not on a program's logic but on its physical structure and appearance. Following them makes your code easier to read, understand, and maintain. Code conventions can include, among others:  
  
-   Standardized formats for labeling and commenting code.  
  
-   Guidelines for spacing, formatting, and indenting code.  
  
-   Naming conventions for objects, variables, and procedures.  
  
 The following topics present a set of programming guidelines for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../VS_csharp/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] programs, along with examples of good usage.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Structure of a Visual Basic Program](../VS_csharp/structure-of-a-visual-basic-program.md)  
 Provides an overview of the elements that make up a [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../VS_csharp/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] program.  
  
 [Main Procedure in Visual Basic](../VS_csharp/main-procedure-in-visual-basic.md)  
 Discusses the procedure that serves as the starting point and overall control for your application.  
  
 [References and the Imports Statement](../VS_csharp/references-and-the-imports-statement--visual-basic-.md)  
 Discusses how to reference objects in other assemblies.  
  
 [Namespaces in Visual Basic](../VS_csharp/namespaces-in-visual-basic.md)  
 Describes how namespaces organize objects within assemblies.  
  
 [Visual Basic Naming Conventions](../VS_csharp/visual-basic-naming-conventions.md)  
 Includes general guidelines for naming procedures, constants, variables, arguments, and objects.  
  
 [Visual Basic Coding Conventions](../VS_csharp/visual-basic-coding-conventions.md)  
 Reviews the guidelines used in developing the samples in this documentation.  
  
 [Conditional Compilation in Visual Basic](../VS_csharp/conditional-compilation-in-visual-basic.md)  
 Describes how to compile particular blocks of code selectively while directing the compiler to ignore others.  
  
 [How to: Break and Combine Statements in Code](../VS_csharp/how-to--break-and-combine-statements-in-code--visual-basic-.md)  
 Shows how to divide long statements into multiple lines and combine short statements on one line.  
  
 [How to: Collapse and Hide Sections of Code](../VS_csharp/how-to--collapse-and-hide-sections-of-code--visual-basic-.md)  
 Shows how to collapse and hide sections of code in the [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../VS_csharp/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] code editor.  
  
 [How to: Label Statements](../VS_csharp/how-to--label-statements--visual-basic-.md)  
 Shows how to mark a line of code to identify it for use with statements such as `On Error Goto`.  
  
 [Special Characters in Code](../VS_csharp/special-characters-in-code--visual-basic-.md)  
 Shows how and where to use non-numeric and non-alphabetic characters.  
  
 [Comments in Code](../VS_csharp/comments-in-code--visual-basic-.md)  
 Discusses how to add descriptive comments to your code.  
  
 [Keywords as Element Names in Code](../VS_csharp/keywords-as-element-names-in-code--visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes how to use brackets (`[]`) to delimit variable names that are also [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../VS_csharp/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] keywords.  
  
 [Me, My, MyBase, and MyClass in Visual Basic](../VS_csharp/me--my--mybase--and-myclass-in-visual-basic.md)  
 Describes various ways to refer to elements of a [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../VS_csharp/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] program.  
  
 [Visual Basic Limitations](../VS_csharp/visual-basic-limitations.md)  
 Discusses the removal of known coding limits within [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../VS_csharp/includes/vbprvb_md.md)].  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Typographic and Code Conventions](../VS_csharp/typographic-and-code-conventions--visual-basic-.md)  
 Provides standard coding conventions for [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../VS_csharp/includes/vbprvb_md.md)].  
  
 [Code and Text Editor](../VS_csharp/writing-code-in-the-code-and-text-editor.md)  
 Describes features that make it easier for you to write and manage your code.
