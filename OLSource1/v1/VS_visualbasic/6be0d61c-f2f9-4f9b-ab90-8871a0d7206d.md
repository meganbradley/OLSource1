# Delegate class &#39;&lt;classname&gt;&#39; has no Invoke method, so an expression of this type cannot be the target of a method call
A call to `Invoke` through a delegate has failed because `Invoke` is not implemented on the delegate class.  
  
 **Error ID:** BC30220  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Ensure that an instance of the delegate class has been created with a `Dim` statement and that a procedure has been assigned to the delegate instance with the `AddressOf` operator.  
  
2.  Locate the code that implements the delegate class and make sure it implements the `Invoke` procedure.
