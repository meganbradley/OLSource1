# Customizing Projects and Extending My with Visual Basic
You can customize project templates to provide additional `My` objects. This makes it easy for other developers to find and use your objects.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Extending the My Namespace in Visual Basic](../VS_visualbasic/extending-the-my-namespace-in-visual-basic.md)  
 Describes how to add custom members and values to the `My` namespace in Visual Basic.  
  
 [Packaging and Deploying Custom My Extensions](../VS_visualbasic/packaging-and-deploying-custom-my-extensions--visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes how to publish custom `My` namespace extensions by using Visual Studio templates.  
  
 [Extending the Visual Basic Application Model](../VS_visualbasic/extending-the-visual-basic-application-model.md)  
 Describes how to specify your own extensions to the application model by overriding members of the \<xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ApplicationServices.WindowsFormsApplicationBase> class.  
  
 [Customizing Which Objects are Available in My](../VS_visualbasic/customizing-which-objects-are-available-in-my--visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes how to control which `My` objects are enabled by setting your project's _MYTYPE conditional-compilation constant.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Development with My](../VS_visualbasic/development-with-my--visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes which `My` objects are available in different project types by default.  
  
 [Overview of the Visual Basic Application Model](../VS_visualbasic/overview-of-the-visual-basic-application-model.md)  
 Describes Visual Basic's model for controlling the behavior of Windows Forms applications.  
  
 [How My Depends on Project Type](../VS_visualbasic/how-my-depends-on-project-type--visual-basic-.md)  
 Describes which `My` objects are available in different project types by default.  
  
 [Conditional Compilation](../VS_visualbasic/conditional-compilation-in-visual-basic.md)  
 Discusses how the compiler uses conditional-compilation to select particular sections of code to compile and exclude other sections.  
  
 \<xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.ApplicationServices.ApplicationBase>  
 Describes the `My` object that provides properties, methods, and events related to the current application.
