# Integration Services Roles (SSIS Service)
  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssISnoversion_md.md)] provides certain fixed database\-level roles to help secure access to packages that are stored in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)]. The available roles are different depending on whether you're saving packages in the SSIS Catalog database \(SSISDB\) or in the msdb database.  
  
## Roles in the SSIS Catalog database \(SSISDB\)  
 The SSIS Catalog database \(SSISDB\) provides the following fixed database\-level roles to help secure access to packages and information about packages.  
  
-   **ssis\_admin**. This role provides full administrative access to the SSIS Catalog database.  
  
-   **ssis\_logreader** This role provides permissions to access all the views related SSISDB operational logs.  
  
     The list of views includes: \[catalog\].\[projects\], \[catalog\].\[packages\], \[catalog\].\[operations\], \[catalog\].\[extended\_operation\_info\], \[catalog\].\[operation\_messages\], \[catalog\].\[event\_messages\], \[catalog\].\[execution\_data\_statistics\], \[catalog\].\[execution\_component\_phases\], \[catalog\].\[execution\_data\_taps\], \[catalog\].\[event\_message\_context\], \[catalog\].\[executions\], \[catalog\].\[executables\], \[catalog\].\[executable\_statistics\], \[catalog\].\[validations\], \[catalog\].\[execution\_parameter\_values\], and \[catalog\].\[execution\_property\_override\_values\].  
  
## Roles in the msdb database  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssISnoversion_md.md)] includes the three fixed database\-level roles,Â **db\_ssisadmin**, **db\_ssisltduser**, and **db\_ssisoperator**, for controlling access to packages that are saved to the **msdb** database. You assign roles to a package using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssManStudioFull_md.md)]. The role assignments are saved to the **msdb** database.  
  
### Read and Write Actions  
 The following table describes the read and write actions of Windows and fixed database\-level roles in [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssISnoversion_md.md)].  
  
|Role|Read action|Write action|  
|----------|-----------------|------------------|  
|**db\_ssisadmin**<br /><br /> or<br /><br /> **sysadmin**|Enumerate own packages.<br /><br /> Enumerate all packages.<br /><br /> View own packages.<br /><br /> View all packages.<br /><br /> Execute own packages.<br /><br /> Execute all packages.<br /><br /> Export own packages.<br /><br /> Export all packages.<br /><br /> Execute all packages in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent.|Import packages.<br /><br /> Delete own packages.<br /><br /> Delete all packages.<br /><br /> Change own package roles.<br /><br /> Change all package roles.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> **\*\* Warning \*\***Members of the db\_ssisadmin role and the dc\_admin role may be able to elevate their privileges to sysadmin. This elevation of privilege can occur because these roles can modify [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssISnoversion_md.md)] packages and [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssISnoversion_md.md)] packages can be executed by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] using the sysadmin security context of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent. To guard against this elevation of privilege when running maintenance plans, data collection sets, and other [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssISnoversion_md.md)] packages, configure [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent jobs that run packages to use a proxy account with limited privileges or only add sysadmin members to the db\_ssisadmin and dc\_admin roles.|  
|**db\_ssisltduser**|Enumerate own packages.<br /><br /> Enumerate all packages.<br /><br /> View own packages.<br /><br /> Execute own packages.<br /><br /> Export own packages.|Import packages.<br /><br /> Delete own packages.<br /><br /> Change own package roles.|  
|**db\_ssisoperator**|Enumerate all packages.<br /><br /> View all packages.<br /><br /> Execute all packages.<br /><br /> Export all packages.<br /><br /> Execute all packages in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent.|None|  
|**Windows administrators**|View execution details of all running packages.|Stop all currently running packages.|  
  
### Sysssispackages Table  
 The **sysssispackages** table in **msdb** contains the packages that are saved to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)]. For more information, see [sysssispackages &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../Topic/sysssispackages%20\(Transact-SQL\).md).  
  
 The **sysssispackages** table includes columns that contain information about the roles that are assigned to packages.  
  
-   The **readerrole** column specifies the role that has read access to the package.  
  
-   The **writerrole** column specifies the role that has write access to the package.  
  
-   The **ownersid** column contains the unique security identifier of the user who created the package. This column defines the owner of the package.  
  
### Permissions  
 By default, the permissions of the **db\_ssisadmin** and **db\_ssisoperator** fixed database\-level roles and the unique security identifier of the user who created the package apply to the reader role for packages, and the permissions of the **db\_ssisadmin** role and the unique security identifier of the user who created the package apply to the writer role. A user must be a member of the **db\_ssisadmin**, **db\_ssisltduser**, or **db\_ssisoperator** role to have read access to the package. A user must be a member of the **db\_ssisadmin** role to have write access.  
  
### Access to Packages  
 The fixed database\-level roles work in conjunction with user\-defined roles. The user\-defined roles are the roles that you create in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] and then use to assign permissions to packages. To access a package, a user must be a member of the user\-defined role and the pertinent [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssISnoversion_md.md)] fixed database\-level role. For example, if users are members of the **AuditUsers** user\-defined role that is assigned to a package, they must also be members of **db\_ssisadmin**, **db\_ssisltduser**, or **db\_ssisoperator** role to have read access to the package.  
  
 If you do not assign user\-defined roles to packages, access to packages is determined by the fixed database\-level roles.  
  
 If you want to use user\-defined roles, you must add them to the **msdb** database before you can assign them to packages. You can create new database roles in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssManStudioFull_md.md)].  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssISnoversion_md.md)] database\-level roles grant rights on the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssISnoversion_md.md)] system tables in the msdb database.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] \(the MSSQLSERVER service\) must be started before you can connect to the Database Engine and access the **msdb** database.  
  
 To assign roles to packages, you need to complete the following tasks.  
  
-   **Open Object Explorer and Connect to Integration Services**  
  
     Before you can assign roles to packages by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssManStudioFull_md.md)], you must open Object Explorer in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] and connect to [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssISnoversion_md.md)].  
  
     The [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssISnoversion_md.md)] service must be started before you can connect to [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssISnoversion_md.md)].  
  
-   **Assign Reader and Writer Roles to Packages**  
  
     You can assign a reader and a writer role to each package.
