# Deprecated Features in SQL Server Replication
  This topic describes the deprecated Replication features that are still available in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Token\Other/ssCurrent_md.md)]. These features are scheduled to be removed in a future release of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)]. Deprecated features should not be used in new applications.  
  
## Items Deprecated in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../Token\Other/ssSQL15_md.md)]  
  
|Feature|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../Token\Other/ssKatmai_md.md)]|Replication is supported if each [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] endpoint is within two major versions of the current version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)]. Consequently, [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../Token\Other/ssSQL15_md.md)] does not support replication to or from [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../Token\Other/ssKatmai_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../../Token\Other/ssKilimanjaro_md.md)].|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssEW](../../Token\Other/ssEW_md.md)]|Replication is supported if each [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] endpoint is within two major versions of the current version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)]. Consequently, [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../Token\Other/ssSQL15_md.md)] does not support replication to or from [!INCLUDE[ssEW](../../Token\Other/ssEW_md.md)].|
