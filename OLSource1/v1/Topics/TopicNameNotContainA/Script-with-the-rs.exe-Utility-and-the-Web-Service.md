# Script with the rs.exe Utility and the Web Service
Developers and report server administrators can perform operations on a report server through the use of the **rs** utility (RS.exe). Using this utility, you can programmatically administer a report server using scripts written with [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/vbprvb_md.md)].  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] scripts can be used to run any of the Report Server Web service operations. Scripting can be used to copy security to multiple reports on a server, to add and delete items, to copy report server items from one server to another and more. For more information about the scripting environment, see [Run a Reporting Services Script File](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Run-a-Reporting-Services-Script-File.md). Script files take a certain format and are written in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] .NET. For more information, see [Format a Reporting Services Script File](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Format-a-Reporting-Services-Script-File.md).
