# Script Organizer (Calculations Tab, Cube Designer) (Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data)
Use the **Script Organizer** pane on the **Calculations** tab in Cube Designer to access and reorder the calculated members, named sets, and script commands contained in the cube script for the specified cube.

## Options  
 **Step**
