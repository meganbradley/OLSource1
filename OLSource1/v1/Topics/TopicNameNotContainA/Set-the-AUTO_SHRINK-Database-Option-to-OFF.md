# Set the AUTO_SHRINK Database Option to OFF
This rule checks whether the AUTO_SHRINK database option is set to OFF. Frequently shrinking and expanding a database can lead to physical fragmentation.  
  
## Best Practices Recommendations  
 Set the AUTO_SHRINK database option to OFF. If you know that the space that you are reclaiming will not be needed in the future, you can reclaim the space by manually shrinking the database.
