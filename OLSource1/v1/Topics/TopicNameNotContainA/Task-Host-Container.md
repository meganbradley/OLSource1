# Task Host Container
  The task host container encapsulates a single task. In [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssIS_md.md)] Designer, the task host is not configured separately; instead, it is configured when you set the properties of the task it encapsulates. For more information about the tasks that the task host containers encapsulate, see [Integration Services Tasks](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Integration-Services-Tasks.md).  
  
 This container extends the use of variables and event handlers to the task level. For more information, see [Integration Services &#40;SSIS&#41; Event Handlers](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Integration-Services--SSIS--Event-Handlers.md) and [Integration Services &#40;SSIS&#41; Variables](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Integration-Services--SSIS--Variables.md).  
  
## Configuration of the Task Host  
 You can set properties in the **Properties** window of [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)] or programmatically.  
  
 For information about setting these properties in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)], see [Set the Properties of a Task or Container](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Set-the-Properties-of-a-Task-or-Container.md).  
  
 For information about programmatically setting these properties, see [TaskHost](assetId:///T:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.TaskHost).
