# Manipulating Data (MDX)
  Multidimensional Expressions \(MDX\) can be used to manipulate the data in a variety of ways. The following topics cover some of the more advanced concepts of data manipulation in the MDX language  
  
## In This Section  
  
|Topic|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[Using DRILLTHROUGH to Retrieve Source Data &#40;MDX&#41;](../Topic/Using%20DRILLTHROUGH%20to%20Retrieve%20Source%20Data%20\(MDX\).md)|Discusses the use of the MDX [DRILLTHROUGH](../Topic/DRILLTHROUGH%20Statement%20\(MDX\).md) statement to retrieve the rowsets of source data applicable to a cell in a multidimensional data source|  
|[Working with the RollupChildren Function &#40;MDX&#41;](../Topic/Working%20with%20the%20RollupChildren%20Function%20\(MDX\).md)|Discusses the impact of the MDX [RollupChildren](../Topic/RollupChildren%20\(MDX\).md)function on the analysis of multidimensional data.|
