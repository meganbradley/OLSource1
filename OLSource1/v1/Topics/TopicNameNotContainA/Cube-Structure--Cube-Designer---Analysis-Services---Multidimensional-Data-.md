# Cube Structure (Cube Designer) (Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data)
  Use the **Cube Structure** tab in **Cube Designer** in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)] to create and modify measure groups and measures, add cube dimensions, and display the objects included in the cube from the associated data source view.  
  
 The **Cube Structure** tab contains the following panes:  
  
## Panes  
  
|Pane|Definition|  
|----------|----------------|  
|**Toolbar**|Use the toolbar to perform common actions in this tab. For more information about this pane, see [Toolbar &#40;Cube Structure Tab, Cube Designer&#41; &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](../Topic/Toolbar%20\(Cube%20Structure%20Tab,%20Cube%20Designer\)%20\(Analysis%20Services%20-%20Multidimensional%20Data\).md).|  
|**Measures**|Use the **Measures** pane to create and modify measure groups and measures for the selected cube. For more information about this pane, see [Measures &#40;Cube Structure Tab, Cube Designer&#41; &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](../Topic/Measures%20\(Cube%20Structure%20Tab,%20Cube%20Designer\)%20\(Analysis%20Services%20-%20Multidimensional%20Data\).md).|  
|**Dimensions**|Use the **Dimensions** pane to include and modify cube dimensions for the selected cube. For more information about this pane, see [Dimensions &#40;Cube Structure Tab, Cube Designer&#41; &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](../Topic/Dimensions%20\(Cube%20Structure%20Tab,%20Cube%20Designer\)%20\(Analysis%20Services%20-%20Multidimensional%20Data\).md).|  
|**Data Source View**|Use the **Data Source View** pane to view and edit the data source view associated with the selected cube. For more information about this pane, see [Data Source View &#40;Cube Structure Tab, Cube Designer&#41; &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](../Topic/Data%20Source%20View%20\(Cube%20Structure%20Tab,%20Cube%20Designer\)%20\(Analysis%20Services%20-%20Multidimensional%20Data\).md).|
