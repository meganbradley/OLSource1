# Replication to Memory-Optimized Table Subscribers
Tables acting as snapshot and transactional replication subscribers, excluding Peer-to-peer transactional replication, can be configured as memory-optimized tables. Other replication configurations are not compatible with memory-optimized tables. This feature is available beginning with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL15_md.md)].  
  
## Two configurations are required  
  
-   **Configure the subscriber database to support replication to memory-optimized tables**  
  
     Set the **@memory_optimized** property  to **true**, by using [sp_addsubscription (Transact-SQL)](assetId:///61ddf287-1fa0-4c1a-8657-ced50cebf0e0) or [sp_changesubscription (Transact-SQL)](assetId:///f9d91fe3-47cf-4915-b6bf-14c9c3d8a029).  
  
-   **Configure the article to support replication to memory-optimized tables**  
  
     Set the `@schema_option = 0x40000000000` option for the article by using [sp_addarticle (Transact-SQL)](assetId:///0483a157-e403-4fdb-b943-23c1b487bef0) or [sp_changearticle (Transact-SQL)](assetId:///24c33ca5-f03a-4417-a267-131ca5ba6bb5).  
  
#### To configure a memory-optimized table as a subscriber  
  
1.  Create a transactional publication. For more information, see [Create a Publication](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Create-a-Publication.md).  
  
2.  Add articles to the publication. For more information, see [Define an Article](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Define-an-Article.md).  
  
     If configuring by using [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/tsql_md.md)] set the **@schema_option** parameter of the **sp_addarticle** stored procedure to   
    **0x40000000000**.  
  
3.  In the article properties window set **Enable Memory optimization** to **true**.  
  
4.  Start the Snapshot Agent job to generate the initial snapshot for this publication. For more information, see [Create and Apply the Initial Snapshot](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Create-and-Apply-the-Initial-Snapshot.md).  
  
5.  Now create a new subscription. In the **New Subscription Wizard** set **Memory Optimized Subscription** to **true**.  
  
 Memory-optimized tables should now start receiving updates from the publisher.  
  
#### Reconfigure an existing transaction replication  
  
1.  Go to subscription properties in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudio_md.md)] and set **Memory Optimized Subscription** to **true**. The changes are not applied until the subscription is reinitialized.  
  
     If configuring by using [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/tsql_md.md)] set the new **@memory_optimized** parameter of the **sp_addsubscription** stored procedure to true.  
  
2.  Go to the article properties  for a publication in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudio_md.md)] and set **Enable Memory** optimization to true.  
  
     If configuring by using [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/tsql_md.md)] set the **@schema_option** parameter of the **sp_addarticle** stored procedure to   
    **0x40000000000**.  
  
3.  Memory optimized tables do not support clustered indexes. To have replication handle this by converting it to nonclustered index on the destination, set **Convert clustered index to nonclustered for memory optimized article** to true.  
  
     If configuring by using [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/tsql_md.md)] set the **@schema_option** parameter of the **sp_addarticle** stored procedure to  **0x0000080000000000**.  
  
4.  Regenerate the snapshot.  
  
5.  Reinitialize the Subscription.  
  
## Remarks and Restrictions  
 Only one-way transactional replication is supported. Peer-to-peer transactional replication is not supported.  
  
 Memory-optimized tables cannot be published.  
  
 Replication tables on the distributor cannot be configured as memory-optimized tables.  
  
 Merge replication cannot include memory-optimized tables.  
  
 At the subscriber, tables involved in transactional replication can be configured as memory optimized tables, but the subscriber tables must meet the requirements of memory-optimized tables. This requires the following restrictions.  
  
-   Tables replicated to memory-optimized tables on a subscriber are limited to the 8060 bytes per row limit of memory-optimized tables.  
  
-   Tables replicated to memory-optimized tables on a subscriber are limited to the data types permitted in memory-optimized tables. For more information, see [Supported Data Types for In-Memory OLTP](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Supported-Data-Types-for-In-Memory-OLTP.md).  
  
-   Foreign key, unique constraint, triggers, schema modifications, ROWGUIDCOL, computed columns, data compression, alias data types, versioning, and locks are not supported in memory-optimized tables. See [Transact-SQL Constructs Not Supported by In-Memory OLTP](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Transact-SQL-Constructs-Not-Supported-by-In-Memory-OLTP.md) for information.  
  
##  <a name="Schema"></a> Modifying a schema file  
  
-   All columns in the key of an index must be specified as **NOT NULL**.  
  
-   If using the memory-optimized table option `DURABILITY = SCHEMA_AND_DATA` the table must have a nonclustered primary key index.  
  
-   ANSI_PADDING must be ON.
