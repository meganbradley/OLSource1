# Union Function (Report Builder and SSRS)
Returns the union of all the non-null numeric values specified by the expression, evaluated in the given scope.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  [!INCLUDE[ssRBRDDup](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRBRDDup_md.md)]  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
Union(expression, scope, recursive)  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *expression*  
 (**SqlGeometry** or **SqlGeography**) The expression on which to perform the aggregation.  
  
 *scope*  
 (**String**) Optional. The name of a dataset, group, or data region that contains the report items to which to apply the aggregate function. If *scope* is not specified, the current scope is used.  
  
 *recursive*  
 (**Enumerated Type**) Optional. **Simple** (default) or **RdlRecursive**. Specifies whether to perform the aggregation recursively.  
  
## Return  
 Returns a spatial object, either **SqlGeometry** or **SqlGeography**, based on the expression type. For more information about **SqlGeometry** and **SqlGeography** spatial data types, see [Spatial Data Types Overview](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Spatial-Data-Types-Overview.md).  
  
## Remarks  
 The set of data specified in the expression must have the same data type.  
  
 The value of *scope* must be a string constant and cannot be an expression. For outer aggregates or aggregates that do not specify other aggregates, *scope* must refer to the current scope or a containing scope. Dataset scopes are not supported. For aggregates of aggregates, nested aggregates can specify a child scope.  
  
 *Expression* can contain calls to nested aggregate functions with the following exceptions and conditions:  
  
-   *Scope* for nested aggregates must be the same as, or contained by, the scope of the outer aggregate. For all distinct scopes in the expression, one scope must be in a child relationship to all other scopes.  
  
-   *Scope* for nested aggregates cannot be the name of a dataset.  
  
-   *Expression* must not contain **First**, **Last**, **Previous**, or **RunningValue** functions.  
  
-   *Expression* must not contain nested aggregates that specify *recursive*.

 For more information about recursive aggregates, see [Creating Recursive Hierarchy Groups (Report Builder and SSRS)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Creating-Recursive-Hierarchy-Groups--Report-Builder-and-SSRS-.md).  
  
## Example  
 The following table shows examples of **SqlGeometry** expressions and **Union** result expression, shown in WKT (Well Known Text) format for spatial data.  
  
|Field with spatial data|Example|Union result|  
|-----------------------------|-------------|------------------|  
|[PointLocation]|POINT(1 2)<br /><br /> POINT(3 4)|MULTIPOINT((1 2), (3 4))|  
|[PathDefinition]|LINESTRING(1 2, 3 4)<br /><br /> LINESTRING(5 6, 7 8)|MULTILINESTRING((7 8, 5 6), (3 4, 1 2))|  
|[PolygonDefinition]|POLYGON((1 2, 3 4, 5 2, 1 2))<br /><br /> POLYGON((-1 2, -3 4, -5 2, -1 2))|MULTIPOLYGON(((1 2, 5 2, 3 4, 1 2)), ((-5 2, -1 2, -3 4, -5 2)))|  
  
```  
=Union(Fields!PointLocation.Value)  
=Union(Fields!PathDefinition.Value)  
=Union(Fields!PolygonDefinition.Value, "Group1")  
```
