# Complete the Wizard (SQL Server Import and Export Wizard)
  After you specify whether you want to run the copy operation immediately, and after you optionally save the package, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Import and Export Wizard shows **Complete the Wizard**. On this page, you review the choices that you made in the wizard.
