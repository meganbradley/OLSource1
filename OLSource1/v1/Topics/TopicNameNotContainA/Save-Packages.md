# Save Packages
In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)] you build packages by using [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssIS_md.md)] Designer and save the packages to the file system as XML files (.dtsx files). You can also save copies of the package XML file to the msdb database in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] or to the package store. The package store represents the folders in the file system location that the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] service manages.  
  
 If you save a package to the file system, you can later use the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] service to import the package to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] or to the package store. For more information, see [Import and Export Packages (SSIS Service)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Import-and-Export-Packages--SSIS-Service-.md).  
  
 You can also use a command prompt utility, **dtutil**, to copy a package between the file system and msdb. For more information, see [dtutil Utility](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/dtutil-Utility.md).
