# Save Packages
  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)] you build packages by using [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../Token\Other/ssIS_md.md)] Designer and save the packages to the file system as XML files \(.dtsx files\). You can also save copies of the package XML file to the msdb database in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] or to the package store. The package store represents the folders in the file system location that the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssISnoversion_md.md)] service manages.  
  
 If you save a package to the file system, you can later use the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssISnoversion_md.md)] service to import the package to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] or to the package store. For more information, see [Import and Export Packages &#40;SSIS Service&#41;](../Topic/Import%20and%20Export%20Packages%20\(SSIS%20Service\).md).  
  
 You can also use a command prompt utility, **dtutil**, to copy a package between the file system and msdb. For more information, see [dtutil Utility](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/dtutil-Utility.md).
