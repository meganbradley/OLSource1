# Importing and Exporting Knowledge
You can create knowledge bases and domains directly in the [!INCLUDE[ssDQSClient](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDQSClient_md.md)] application, or you can import knowledge into, or export it from, a knowledge base. In the [!INCLUDE[ssDQSClient](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDQSClient_md.md)] application, you can use a data file for import and export operations, or an Excel file for import operations. The data file used is an encrypted file that is created by [!INCLUDE[ssDQSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDQSnoversion_md.md)] (DQS) with a .dqs extension. The files created by Microsoft Excel can have an extension of .xlsx, .xls, or .csv. These operations give you more flexibility in building and sharing the knowledge that you use to perform data cleansing and matching.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You can export *all* the knowledge bases in your [!INCLUDE[ssDQSServer](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDQSServer_md.md)] to a DQS backup file (.dqsb) at once by running the DQSInstaller.exe file from the command prompt. Similarly, you can import *all* the knowledge bases from a DQS backup file (.dqsb) to your [!INCLUDE[ssDQSServer](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDQSServer_md.md)] at once by running the DQSInstaller.exe file from the command prompt. For information about doing so, see [Export and Import DQS Knowledge Bases Using DQSInstaller.exe](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Export-and-Import-DQS-Knowledge-Bases-Using-DQSInstaller.exe.md) in the DQS installation guide.
