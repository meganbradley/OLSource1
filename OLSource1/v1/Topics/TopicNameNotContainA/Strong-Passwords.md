# Strong Passwords
Passwords can be the weakest link in a server security deployment. You should always take great care when you select a password. A strong password has the following characteristics:  
  
-   Is at least 8 characters long.  
  
-   Combines letters, numbers, and symbol characters within the password.  
  
-   Is not found in a dictionary.  
  
-   Is not the name of a command.  
  
-   Is not the name of a person.  
  
-   Is not the name of a user.  
  
-   Is not the name of a computer.  
  
-   Is changed regularly.  
  
-   Is significantly different from previous passwords.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] passwords can contain up to 128 characters, including letters, symbols, and digits. Because logins, user names, roles, and passwords are frequently used in [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/tsql_md.md)] statements, certain symbols must be enclosed by double quotation marks (") or square brackets ([ ]). Use these delimiters in [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/tsql_md.md)] statements when the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] login, user, role, or password has the following characteristics:  
  
-   Contains or starts with a space character.  
  
-   Starts with the $ or @ character.  
  
 If used in an OLE DB or ODBC connection string, a login or password must not contain the following characters: [] {}() , ; ? * ! @. These characters are used to either initialize a connection or separate connection values.
