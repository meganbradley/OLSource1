# SQL Server Integration Services Properties (Log On Tab)
Use the **Log On** tab of the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] **Properties** dialog box to specify the account used by the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] service, and to start and stop the service.  
  
## Options  
 **Local System account**  
 Specify a local system account, which does not require a password. However, the local system account may restrict the service from interacting with other servers, depending on the privileges granted to the account.

[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] recommends using a domain user account with minimal rights for services. For information about selecting an account, search Books Online for the topic, "Setting Up Windows Service Accounts."  
  
 **Account Name**  
 Specify the local or domain user account name.  
  
 **Password**
