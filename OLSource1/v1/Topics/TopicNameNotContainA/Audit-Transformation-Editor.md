# Audit Transformation Editor
The Audit transformation enables the data flow in a package to include data about the environment in which the package runs. For example, the name of the package, computer, and operator can be added to the data flow. [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] includes system variables that provide this information.
