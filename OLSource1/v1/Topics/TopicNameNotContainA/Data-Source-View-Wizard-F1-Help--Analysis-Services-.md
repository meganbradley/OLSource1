# Data Source View Wizard F1 Help (Analysis Services)
  Use the Data Source View Wizard to create a data source view for use in the following business intelligence projects in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)]:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Token\Other/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssASnoversion_md.md)] Project  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Token\Other/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssISnoversion_md.md)] Project  
  
-   Report Model Project  
  
 Depending on the database structure, the Data Source View Wizard guides you through some or all the following steps:  
  
-   Specifying the underlying data source.  
  
-   Setting naming conventions to help in identifying relationships.  
  
-   Selecting tables and views for the data source view.  
  
-   Naming and saving the data source view.  
  
 After you create a data source view, you can use Data Source View Designer to change the view's properties in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudio](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudio_md.md)].
