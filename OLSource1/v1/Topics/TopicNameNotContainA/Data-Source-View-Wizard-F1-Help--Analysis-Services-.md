# Data Source View Wizard F1 Help (Analysis Services)
Use the Data Source View Wizard to create a data source view for use in the following business intelligence projects in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)]:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] Project  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] Project  
  
-   Report Model Project  
  
 Depending on the database structure, the Data Source View Wizard guides you through some or all the following steps:  
  
-   Specifying the underlying data source.  
  
-   Setting naming conventions to help in identifying relationships.  
  
-   Selecting tables and views for the data source view.  
  
-   Naming and saving the data source view.  
  
 After you create a data source view, you can use Data Source View Designer to change the view's properties in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudio](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudio_md.md)]. For more information about Data Source View Designer, see [Data Source View Designer (Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Data-Source-View-Designer--Analysis-Services---Multidimensional-Data-.md).
