# Install Analysis Services in Multidimensional and Data Mining Mode
  [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssASnoversion_md.md)] provides online analytical processing \(OLAP\) and data mining functionality for business intelligence applications. In this release, support for OLAP databases and data mining models is available when you install [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssASnoversion_md.md)] in *Multidimensional mode*. Multidimensional mode is one of three server modes that [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssASnoversion_md.md)] runs in. It is the default mode. If you install [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssASnoversion_md.md)] using default values, you will get an instance that runs multidimensional databases and data mining models.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssASnoversion_md.md)] is a multi\-instance feature, which means that you can install more than one instance [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssASnoversion_md.md)] on a single computer, or run a new instance of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssASnoversion_md.md)] side\-by\-side an earlier version. Server mode is specific to an instance. Using other modes requires that you install additional instances of the server.  
  
 You can install [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssASnoversion_md.md)] by itself or with other components. If you install just [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssASnoversion_md.md)], the following features are installed when you select **Analysis Services** on the Feature Selection page of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Installation Wizard:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssASnoversion_md.md)] server for running [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssASnoversion_md.md)] databases and data mining models  
  
-   Data providers used for [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssASnoversion_md.md)] data access to source databases  
  
-   SQL Server Configuration Manager  
  
## Choosing additional features  
 Analysis Services OLAP and data warehouse solutions will require the installation of additional [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] components to enable the development, deployment, and administration of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssASnoversion_md.md)] databases. The following additional features are options for many typical user scenarios:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)], used to create and view Analysis Services data structures and data mining models.  
  
-   Client tools connectivity components, used for communication between clients and servers, including network libraries for DB\-Library, ODBC, and OLEÂ DB.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssISnoversion_md.md)], a set of graphical and programmable objects for moving, copying, and transforming data.  
  
-   Management tools, including [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Configuration Manager, [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssManStudioFull_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../Token\Other/ssSqlProfiler_md.md)], and Replication Monitor.
