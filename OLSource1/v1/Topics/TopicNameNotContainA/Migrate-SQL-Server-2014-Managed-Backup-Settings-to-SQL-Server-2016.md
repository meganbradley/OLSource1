# Migrate SQL Server 2014 Managed Backup Settings to SQL Server 2016
This topic covers migration considerations for [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ss_smartbackup_md.md)] when upgrading from [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL14_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL15_md.md)].  
  
 The procedures and underlying behavior of [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ss_smartbackup_md.md)] has changed in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL15_md.md)]. The following sections describe the functional changes and their implications.  
  
## Overview  
 The following table describes some of the key functional differences for [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ss_smartbackup_md.md)] between [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL14_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL15_md.md)].  
  
|Area|[!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL14_md.md)]|[!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL15_md.md)]|  
|----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|  
|**Namespace:**|smart_admin|managed_backup|  
|**System Stored Procedures:**|sp_set_db_backup<br /><br /> sp_set_instance_backup|[sp_backup_config_basic](assetId:///3ad73051-ae9a-4e41-a889-166146e5508f)<br /><br /> [sp_backup_config_advanced](assetId:///4fae8193-1f88-48fd-a94a-4786efe8d6af)<br /><br /> [sp_backup_config_schedule](assetId:///82541160-d1df-4061-91a5-6868dd85743a)|  
|**Security:**|SQL credential using a Microsoft Azure storage account and access key.|SQL credential using a Microsoft Azure Shared Access Signature (SAS) token.|  
|**Underlying Storage:**|Microsoft Azure Storage using page blobs.|Microsoft Azure Storage using block blobs.|  
  
## Benefits  
 There are several benefits to using the new functionality in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL15_md.md)].  
  
-   Block blobs cost less to store.  
  
-   With striping, you can store much larger backups (12 TB versus 1 TB for page blobs).  
  
-   Striping also improves the restore time for large databases  
  
-   For other improvements to [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ss_smartbackup_md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL15_md.md)], see [SQL Server Managed Backup to Microsoft Azure](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/SQL-Server-Managed-Backup-to-Microsoft-Azure.md).  
  
## Considerations  
 After you upgrade from [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL14_md.md)], note the following [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ss_smartbackup_md.md)] considerations:  
  
-   Any databases previously configured for [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ss_smartbackup_md.md)] on [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL14_md.md)] will continue to use the **smart_admin** system procedures and underlying behavior on [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL15_md.md)].  
  
-   The **smart_admin** procedures are not supported for any new configurations of [!INCLUDE[ss_smartbackup](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ss_smartbackup_md.md)] on [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL15_md.md)]. You must use the new **managed_backup** procedures and functionality.
