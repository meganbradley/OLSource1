# Assign Model Object Permissions (Master Data Services)
In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)], assign permissions to model objects when you need to give a user or group access to data in the **Explorer** functional area of [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSmdm_md.md)], or when you need to make a user or group an administrator.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  When you assign permission to a model, permission to all other models is implicitly denied. If you do not assign model object permissions, the user or group cannot access any data in **Explorer**.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have permission to access the **Users and Group Permissions** functional area.  
  
-   You must be a model administrator. For more information, see [Administrators (Master Data Services)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Administrators--Master-Data-Services-.md).  
  
### To assign model object permissions  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSmdm_md.md)], click **User and Group Permissions**.  
  
2.  On the **Users** or **Groups** page, select the row for the user or group that you want to edit.  
  
3.  Click **Edit selected user**.  
  
4.  Click the **Models** tab.  
  
5.  Optionally, select a model from the **Model** list.  
  
6.  Click **Edit**.  
  
7.  Expand the tree, and click the model object you want to assign permissions to.  
  
8.  From the menu, select a combination of Read, Create, Update and Delete, or Deny.  
  
9. On the top model level, select **Admin** if you need to make a user model administrator.  
  
10. Click **Save**.
