# View the Extended Events Targets for Registered Packages
Before you create a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Extended Events session, it is useful to determine what Extended Events targets are available. This task involves using Query Editor in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] to perform the following procedure.  
  
 After the statements in this procedure finish, the **Results** tab of Query Editor displays the following two columns:  
  
-   package_name  
  
-   target_name  
  
## To view the Extended Events targets for registered packages using Query Editor  
  
-   In Query Editor, issue the following statements.  
  
    ```  
    USE msdb  
    SELECT p.name package_name, o.name target_name  
    FROM sys.dm_xe_objects o  
    JOIN sys.dm_xe_packages p  
         ON o.package_guid = p.guid  
    WHERE o.object_type = 'target'  
    ```
