# Managing Memory for In-Memory OLTP
  Memory\-optimized tables require that sufficient memory exist to keep all of the rows and indexes in memory. Because memory is a finite resource, it is important that you understand and manage memory usage on your system. The topics in this section cover common memory use and management scenarios.
