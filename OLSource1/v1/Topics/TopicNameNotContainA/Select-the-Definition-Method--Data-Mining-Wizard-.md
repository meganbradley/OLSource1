# Select the Definition Method (Data Mining Wizard)
  Use the **Select the Definition Method** page to select the source for creating the new mining model. Your path through the wizard will be different depending on your selection, because a mining structure that is based on a cube requires different steps to construct than a mining structure that is based on a relational data source.  
  
 **For More information:** [Create a Relational Mining Structure](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/Create-a-Relational-Mining-Structure.md), [Data Mining Wizard &#40;Analysis Services - Data Mining&#41;](../Topic/Data%20Mining%20Wizard%20\(Analysis%20Services%20-%20Data%20Mining\).md)  
  
## Options  
 **From existing relational database or data warehouse**  
 Select to create the mining model from an existing relational database or data warehouse.  
  
 **From existing cube**  
 Select to create the mining model from an existing cube.
