# Master Data Services Overview (MDS)
  This article describes the building blocks of [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Token\Other/ssMDSshort_md.md)]. For information about the new features  in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Token\Other/ssCurrent_md.md)], see [What's New in Master Data Services &#40;MDS&#41;](../Topic/What's%20New%20in%20Master%20Data%20Services%20\(MDS\).md)  
  
 **To  install [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Token\Other/ssMDSshort_md.md)], set up the database and Website, and deploy the sample models, see** [Master Data Services](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/Master-Data-Services.md).  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Token\Other/ssMDSshort_md.md)], the model is the highest level container in the structure of your master data. You create a model to manage groups of similar data, for example to manage online product data. A model contains one or more entities, and entities contain members that are the data records. An entity is similar to a table.  
  
 For example, your online product model may contain entities such as product, color, and style. The  color entity may contain  members for the colors red, silver, and black.  
  
 ![Color entity](../../Images\Image\ImageNotContaina/mds_productmodel_colorentity_composite.png "mds_productmodel_colorentity_composite")  
  
 Models also contain attributes that are defined within entities. An attribute contains values that help describe the entity members. There are free\-form attributes and domain\-based attributes.  A domain\-based attribute contains values that are populated by members from an entity and can be used as attribute values for other entities.  
  
 For example, the product entity might have free\-form attributes for cost and weight. And, there is a domain\-based attribute for color ![Number 1](../../Images\Image\ImageNotContaina/mds_Number1.png "mds_Number1") that contains values that are populated by the color entity members. This  master list of colors is used as attribute values for the Product entity ![Number 2](../../Images\Image\ImageNotContaina/mds_Number2.png "mds_Number2").  
  
 ![Domain-based attribute for color](../../Images\Image\ImageNotContaina/mds_productentity_color_domainattribute.png "mds_productentity_color_domainattribute")  
  
 Derived hierarchies come from the relationships between entities in a model. These are domain\-based attribute relationships. In the product model for example, you can have a color derived hierarchy ![Number 1](../../Images\Image\ImageNotContaina/mds_Number1.png "mds_Number1") that comes from the relationship between the color ![Number 2](../../Images\Image\ImageNotContaina/mds_Number2.png "mds_Number2") and product ![Number 3](../../Images\Image\ImageNotContaina/mds_Number3.png "mds_Number3") entities.  
  
 ![Color derived hierarchy](../../Images\Image\ImageNotContaina/mds_derivedhierarchy.png "mds_derivedhierarchy")  
  
 Once you've defined  a basic structure for your data, you can start adding data records \(members\) by using the import feature. You load data into staging tables,  validate the data using business rules, and load the data into  MDS tables.  You can also use business rules to set attribute values.  
  
 The following table outlines the key [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Token\Other/ssMDSshort_md.md)] tasks. Unless otherwise noted, all of the following procedures require you to be a model administrator. For more information, see [Administrators &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../Topic/Administrators%20\(Master%20Data%20Services\).md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You might want to complete the following tasks in a test environment and use the sample data provided when you install [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Token\Other/ssMDSshort_md.md)].Â For more information, see [Deploying Models &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../Topic/Deploying%20Models%20\(Master%20Data%20Services\).md).

|Create attribute groups|If you have more than four or five attributes for an entity, you might want to create attribute groups. These groups are the tabs that are displayed above the grid in **Explorer** and they help ease navigation by grouping attributes together on individual tabs.|[Attribute Groups &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../Topic/Attribute%20Groups%20\(Master%20Data%20Services\).md)<br /><br /> [Create an Attribute Group &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../Topic/Create%20an%20Attribute%20Group%20\(Master%20Data%20Services\).md)|  
|Import members for your supporting entities|Import the data for your supporting entities by using the staging process. For the Product model, this might mean importing colors or sizes. You can also create members manually.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> Note: Users can create members in [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../../Token\Other/ssMDSmdm_md.md)] if they have a minimum of **Update** permission to an entity's leaf model object and access to the **Explorer** functional area.|[Overview: Importing Data from Tables &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../Topic/Overview:%20Importing%20Data%20from%20Tables%20\(Master%20Data%20Services\).md)<br /><br /> [Create a Leaf Member &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../Topic/Create%20a%20Leaf%20Member%20\(Master%20Data%20Services\).md)|

|Import members for your primary entities and apply business rules|Import the members for your primary entities by using the staging process. When done, validate the version, which applies business rules to all members in the model version.<br /><br /> You can then work to correct any business rule validation issues.|[Validation &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../Topic/Validation%20\(Master%20Data%20Services\).md)<br /><br /> [Validate a Version against Business Rules &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../Topic/Validate%20a%20Version%20against%20Business%20Rules%20\(Master%20Data%20Services\).md)<br /><br /> [Validation Stored Procedure &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../Topic/Validation%20Stored%20Procedure%20\(Master%20Data%20Services\).md)|  
|Create derived hierarchies|Derived hierarchies can be updated as your business needs change and ensure that all members are accounted for at the appropriate level.|[Derived Hierarchies &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../Topic/Derived%20Hierarchies%20\(Master%20Data%20Services\).md)<br /><br /> [Create a Derived Hierarchy &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../Topic/Create%20a%20Derived%20Hierarchy%20\(Master%20Data%20Services\).md)|

|Lock a version of your model and assign a version flag|Lock a version of your model to prevent changes to the members, except by administrators. When the version's data has validated successfully against business rules, you can commit the version, which prevents changes to members by all users.<br /><br /> Create and assign a version flag to the model. Flags help users and subscribing systems identify which version of a model to use.|[Versions &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../Topic/Versions%20\(Master%20Data%20Services\).md)<br /><br /> [Lock a Version &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../Topic/Lock%20a%20Version%20\(Master%20Data%20Services\).md)<br /><br /> [Create a Version Flag &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../Topic/Create%20a%20Version%20Flag%20\(Master%20Data%20Services\).md)|  
|Create subscription views|For your subscribing systems to consume your master data, create subscription views, which create standard views in the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Token\Other/ssMDSshort_md.md)] database.|[Overview: Exporting Data &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../Topic/Overview:%20Exporting%20Data%20\(Master%20Data%20Services\).md)<br /><br /> [Create a Subscription View to Export Data &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../Topic/Create%20a%20Subscription%20View%20to%20Export%20Data%20\(Master%20Data%20Services\).md)|  
|Configure user and group permissions|You cannot copy user and group permissions from a test to a production environment. However, you can use your test environment to determine the security you want to use eventually in production.|[Security &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../Topic/Security%20\(Master%20Data%20Services\).md)<br /><br /> [Add a Group &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../Topic/Add%20a%20Group%20\(Master%20Data%20Services\).md)<br /><br /> [Add a User &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../Topic/Add%20a%20User%20\(Master%20Data%20Services\).md)|  
  
 When ready, you can deploy your model, with or without its data, to your production environment. For more information, see [Deploying Models &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../Topic/Deploying%20Models%20\(Master%20Data%20Services\).md).
