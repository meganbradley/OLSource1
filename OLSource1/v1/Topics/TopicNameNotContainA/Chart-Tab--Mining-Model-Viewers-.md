# Chart Tab (Mining Model Viewers)
  Use the **Chart** pane to display the historical data used in training a time series model, together with the predicted values. The vertical axis of the chart represents the value of the series, and the horizontal axis represents time. Future predictions are represented by a dotted line.  
  
 **For More Information:** [Microsoft Time Series Algorithm](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/Microsoft-Time-Series-Algorithm.md), [Browse a Model Using the Microsoft Time Series Viewer](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/Browse-a-Model-Using-the-Microsoft-Time-Series-Viewer.md)  
  
## Options  
 **Refresh viewer content**  
 Reload the mining model in the viewer.  
  
 **Mining Model**  
 Choose a mining model, from those in the current mining structure. The mining model will open in its associated viewer.  
  
 **Viewer**  
 Choose a viewer to explore the selected mining model. You can use the custom viewer for time series models, or the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Token\Other/msCoName_md.md)] Mining Content Viewer. You can also use plug\-in viewers if available.  
  
 **Zoom In**  
 Zoom in to the chart.  
  
 **Zoom Out**  
 Zoom out from the chart.  
  
 **Scale diagram to fit window**  
 Zoom out from the chart until the whole chart fits within the screen.  
  
 **Abs**  
 Switch between two chart views: in the default view numbers are graphed relative to the overall distribution \(as percentage\). If you click **Abs**, the numbers are graphed as absolute values.  
  
 **Copy the charts to the clipboard**  
 Copy the complete chart to the clipboard.  
  
 **Show Deviations**  
 Select this option to add error bars to the graph. Error bars represent the variance of the predictions and therefore appear only on the predicted values.  
  
 **Prediction steps**  
 Choose how many future time steps you want to see in the viewer.  
  
 **Series selection**  
 Open a dialog box from which you can select series to include in the viewer.
