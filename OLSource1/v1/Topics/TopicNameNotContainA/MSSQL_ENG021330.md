# MSSQL_ENG021330
## Message Details  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Product Name|SQL Server|  
|Event ID|21330|  
|Event Source|MSSQLSERVER|  
|Component|[!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDEnoversion_md.md)]|  
|Symbolic Name||  
|Message Text|Failed to create a sub-directory under the replication working directory.(%ls)|  
  
## Explanation  
 This error can occur when a subscription is initialized manually, and there is a problem creating the directory in which replication scripts are stored. The error can be caused by a permissions issue: when a subscription is initialized without using a snapshot, the account under which the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] service runs at the Publisher must have write permissions on the snapshot folder at the Distributor.  
  
## User Action  
 Ensure that the correct path has been specified for the snapshot folder and that the account under which the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] service runs at the Publisher has sufficient permissions.
