# Surface Area Configuration
In the default configuration of new installations of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)], many features are not enabled. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] selectively installs and starts only key services and features, to minimize the number of features that can be attacked by a malicious user. A system administrator can change these defaults at installation time and also selectively enable or disable features of a running instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)]. Additionally, some components may not be available when connecting from other computers until protocols are configured.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Unlike new installations, no existing services or features are turned off during an upgrade, but additional surface area configuration options can be applied after the upgrade is completed.  
  
## Protocols, Connection, and Startup Options  
 Use [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Configuration Manager to start and stop services, configure the startup options, and enable protocols and other connection options.  
  
#### To start SQL Server Configuration Manager  
  
1.  On the **Start** menu, point to **All Programs**, point to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrentUI](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrentUI_md.md)], point to **Configuration Tools**, and then click **SQL Server Configuration Manager**.  
  
    -   Use the **SQL Server Services** area to start components and configure the automatic starting options.  
  
    -   Use the **SQL Server Network Configuration** area to enable connection protocols, and connection options such as fixed TCP/IP ports, or forcing encryption.  
  
 For more information, see [SQL Server Configuration Manager](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/SQL-Server-Configuration-Manager.md). Remote connectivity can also depend upon the correct configuration of a firewall. For more information, see [Configure the Windows Firewall to Allow SQL Server Access](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Configure-the-Windows-Firewall-to-Allow-SQL-Server-Access.md).  
  
## Enabling and Disabling Features  
 Enabling and disabling [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] features can be configured using facets in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)].  
  
#### To configure surface area using facets  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudio_md.md)] connect to a component of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)].  
  
2.  In Object Explorer, right-click the server, and then click **Facets**.  
  
3.  In the **View Facets** dialog box, expand the **Facet** list, and select the appropriate **Surface Area Configuration** facet (**Surface Area Configuration**, **Surface Area Configuration for Analysis Services**, or **Surface Area Configuration for Reporting Services**).  
  
4.  In the **Facet properties** area, select the values that you want for each property.  
  
5.  [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/clickOK_md.md)]  
  
 To periodically check the configuration of a facet, use Policy-Based Management. For more information about Policy-Based Management, see [Administer Servers by Using Policy-Based Management](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Administer-Servers-by-Using-Policy-Based-Management.md).  
  
 You can also set [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)] options using the **sp_configure** stored procedure. For more information, see [Server Configuration Options (SQL Server)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Server-Configuration-Options--SQL-Server-.md).  
  
 To change the **EnableIntegrated Security** property of [!INCLUDE[ssRS](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ssRS_md.md)], use the property settings in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)]. To change the **Schedule events and report delivery** property and the **Web service and HTTP access** property, edit the **RSReportServer.config** configuration file.  
  
## Command-prompt Options  
 Use the **Invoke-PolicyEvaluation**[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] PowerShell cmdlet to invoke Surface Area Configuration Policies. For more information, see [Use the Database Engine cmdlets](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Use-the-Database-Engine-cmdlets.md).  
  
## SOAP and Service Broker Endpoints  
 To turn endpoints off, use Policy-Based Management. To create and alter the properties of endpoints, use [CREATE ENDPOINT (Transact-SQL)](assetId:///6405e7ec-0b5b-4afd-9792-1bfa5a2491f6) and [ALTER ENDPOINT (Transact-SQL)](assetId:///70f35566-30cf-47c6-8394-dfe5d71629d3).
