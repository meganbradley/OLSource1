# Upgrading the Packages (SSIS Package Upgrade Wizard)
Use the **Upgrading the Packages** page to view the progress of package upgrade and to interrupt the upgrade process. The [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssIS_md.md)] Package Upgrade Wizard upgrades the selected packages one by one.  
  
 **To view upgraded packages that were saved to a SQL Server database or to the package store**  
  
-   In [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudio_md.md)], in Object Explorer, connect to the local instance of [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)], and then expand the **Stored Packages** node to see the packages that were upgraded.  
  
 **To view upgraded packages that were upgraded from SQL Server Data Tools**  
  
-   In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)], in Solution Explorer, open the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] project, and then expand the **SSIS Packages** node to see the upgraded packages.
