# Notifications (Master Data Services)
[!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)] can be configured to send an email notification when business rule validation fails, the status of a model version changes, or the status of a changeset changes.  
  
## How Notifications Are Sent  
 You configure notifications in [!INCLUDE[ssMDScfgmgr](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDScfgmgr_md.md)]. Notifications send email messages by using Database Mail on the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)] that hosts the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)] database. For more information about Database Mail, see [Database Mail Configuration Objects](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Database-Mail-Configuration-Objects.md) in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Books Online.  
  
## When Notifications Are Sent  
 After notifications are configured, automated email notifications can be sent in the following instances.

## System Settings  
 There are settings in [!INCLUDE[ssMDScfgmgr](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDScfgmgr_md.md)] that affect notifications. You can adjust these settings in [!INCLUDE[ssMDScfgmgr](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDScfgmgr_md.md)] or directly in the System Settings table in the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)] database.
