# Check Database Integrity Task
The Check Database Integrity task checks the allocation and structural integrity of all the objects in the specified database. The task can check a single database or multiple databases, and you can choose whether to also check the database indexes.  
  
 The Check Database Integrity task encapsulates the DBCC CHECKDB statement. For more information, see [How to: Set Task Properties](assetId:///2c506167-0b69-49f7-9282-241e411910df).
