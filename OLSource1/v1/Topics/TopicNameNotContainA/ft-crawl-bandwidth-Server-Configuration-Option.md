# ft crawl bandwidth Server Configuration Option
  Use the **ft crawl bandwidth** option to specify the size to which the pool of large memory buffers can grow. Large memory buffers are 4Â megabytes \(MB\) in size. The **max** parameter value specifies the maximum number of buffers that the full\-text memory manager should maintain in a large buffer pool. If the **max** value is zero, then there is no upper limit to the number of buffers that can be in a large buffer pool.  
  
 The **min** parameter specifies the minimum number of memory buffers that must be maintained in the pool of large memory buffers. Upon request from the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Token\Other/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] memory manager, all extra buffer pools will be released but this minimum number of buffers will be maintained. If, however, the **min** value specified is zero, then all memory buffers are released.  
  
 Under certain circumstances, the number of buffers currently allocated is less than the value specified by the **min** parameter.
