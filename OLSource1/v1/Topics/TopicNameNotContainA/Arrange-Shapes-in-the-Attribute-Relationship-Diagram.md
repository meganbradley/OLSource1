# Arrange Shapes in the Attribute Relationship Diagram
You can change the layout of the shapes on the **Attribute Relationships** tab of the Dimension Structure view in Dimension Designer in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)].  
  
### To arrange shapes in the attribute relationship diagram  
  
1.  In Dimension Designer, open the dimension that contains the attributes that you want to create an attribute relationship between.  
  
2.  On the **Attribute Relationships** tab, in the diagram, click a shape to select it, and then grab the shape by the top edge and drag it to the new location.  
  
     You can also click **Arrange Shapes** to automatically arrange all shapes according to the layout algorithm that Dimension Designer uses.
