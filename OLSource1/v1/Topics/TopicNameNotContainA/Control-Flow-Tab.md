# Control Flow Tab
  Use the **Control Flow** tab of [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../Token\Other/ssIS_md.md)] Designer to build the control flow in aÂ [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssISnoversion_md.md)] package.  
  
 Create the control flow by dragging graphical objects that represent [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../Token\Other/ssIS_md.md)] tasks and containers from the **Toolbox** to the design surface of the **Control Flow** tab, and then connecting the objects by dragging the connector on an object to another object. Each connecting line represents a precedence constraint that specifies the order in which the tasks and containers run  
  
 Additionally, you can use [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../Token\Other/ssIS_md.md)] Designer to add the following functionality from the **Control Flow** tab:  
  
-   Implement logging  
  
-   Create package configurations  
  
-   Sign the package with a certificate  
  
-   Manage variables  
  
-   Add annotations  
  
-   Configure breakpoints  
  
 To add these functions to individual tasks or containers in [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../Token\Other/ssIS_md.md)] Designer, right\-click the object on the design surface, and then select the option.
