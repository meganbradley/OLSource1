# Configure Snapshot Properties (Replication Transact-SQL Programming)
Snapshot properties can be defined and modified programmatically using replication stored procedures, where the stored procedures used depend on the type of publication.  
  
### To configure snapshot properties when creating a snapshot or transactional publication  
  
1.  At the Publisher, execute [sp_addpublication](assetId:///c7167ed1-2b7e-4824-b82b-65f4667c4407). Specify a publication name for **@publication**, a value of either **snapshot** or **continuous** for **@repl_freq**, and one or more of the following snapshot-related parameters:  
  
    -   **@alt_snapshot_folder** - specify a path if the snapshot for this publication is accessed from that location instead of or in addition to the snapshot default folder.  
  
    -   **@compress_snapshot** - specify a value of **true** if the snapshot files in the alternate snapshot folder are compressed in the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] CAB file format.  
  
    -   **@pre_snapshot_script** - specify the file name and full path of a **.sql** file that will be executed at the Subscriber during initialization before the initial snapshot is applied.  
  
    -   **@post_snapshot_script** - specify the file name and full path of a **.sql** file that will be executed at the Subscriber during initialization after the initial snapshot is applied.  
  
    -   **@snapshot_in_defaultfolder** - specify a value of **false** if the snapshot is available only in a non-default location.  
  
     For more information about creating publications, see [Create a Publication](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Create-a-Publication.md).  
  
### To configure snapshot properties when creating a merge publication  
  
1.  At the Publisher, execute [sp_addmergepublication](assetId:///28a629a1-7374-4614-9b04-279d290a942a). Specify a publication name for **@publication**, a value of either **snapshot** or **continuous** for **@repl_freq**, and one or more of the following snapshot-related parameters:  
  
    -   **@alt_snapshot_folder** - specify a path if the snapshot for this publication is accessed from that location instead of or in addition to the snapshot default folder.  
  
    -   **@compress_snapshot** - specify a value of **true** if the snapshot files in the alternate snapshot folder are compressed in the CAB file format.  
  
    -   **@pre_snapshot_script** - specify the file name and full path of a **.sql** file that will be executed at the Subscriber during initialization before the initial snapshot is applied.  
  
    -   **@post_snapshot_script** - specify the file name and full path of a **.sql** file that will be executed at the Subscriber during initialization after the initial snapshot is applied.  
  
    -   **@snapshot_in_defaultfolder** - specify a value of **false** if the snapshot is available only in a non-default location.  
  
2.  For more information about creating publications, see [Create a Publication](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Create-a-Publication.md).  
  
### To modify snapshot properties of an existing snapshot or transactional publication  
  
1.  At the Publisher on the publication database, execute [sp_changepublication](assetId:///c36e5865-25d5-42b7-b045-dc5036225081). Specify a value of **1** for **@force_invalidate_snapshot** and one of the following values for **@property**:  
  
    -   **alt_snapshot_folder** -also specify a new path to the alternate snapshot folder for **@value**.  
  
    -   **compress_snapshot** - also specify a value of either **true** or **false** for **@value** to indicate whether the snapshot files in the alternate snapshot folder are compressed in the CAB file format.  
  
    -   **pre_snapshot_script** - also for **@value** specify the file name and full path of a **.sql** file that will be executed at the Subscriber during initialization before the initial snapshot is applied.  
  
    -   **post_snapshot_script** - also for **@value** specify the file name and full path of a **.sql** file that will be executed at the Subscriber during initialization after the initial snapshot is applied.  
  
    -   **snapshot_in_defaultfolder** - also specify a value of either **true** or **false** to indicate whether the snapshot is available only in a non-default location.  
  
2.  (Optional) At the Publisher on the publication database, execute [sp_changepublication_snapshot](assetId:///518a4618-3592-4edc-8425-cbc33cdff891). Specify **@publication** and one or more of the scheduling or security credential parameters being changed.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  When possible, prompt users to enter security credentials at runtime. If you must store credentials in a script file, you must secure the file to prevent unauthorized access.  
  
3.  Run the [Replication Snapshot Agent](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Replication-Snapshot-Agent.md) from the command prompt or start the Snapshot Agent job to generate a new snapshot. For more information, see [Create and Apply the Initial Snapshot](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Create-and-Apply-the-Initial-Snapshot.md).  
  
### To modify snapshot properties of an existing merge publication  
  
1.  At the Publisher on the publication database, execute [sp_changemergepublication](assetId:///81fe1994-7678-4852-980b-e02fedf1e796). Specify a value of **1** for **@force_invalidate_snapshot** and one of the following values for **@property**:  
  
    -   **alt_snapshot_folder** -also specify a new path to the alternate snapshot folder for **@value**.  
  
    -   **compress_snapshot** - also specify a value of either **true** or **false** for **@value** to indicate whether the snapshot files in the alternate snapshot folder are compressed in the CAB file format.  
  
    -   **pre_snapshot_script** - also for **@value** specify the file name and full path of a **.sql** file that will be executed at the Subscriber during initialization before the initial snapshot is applied.  
  
    -   **post_snapshot_script** - also for **@value** specify the file name and full path of a **.sql** file that will be executed at the Subscriber during initialization after the initial snapshot is applied.  
  
    -   **snapshot_in_defaultfolder** - also specify a value of either **true** or **false** to indicate whether the snapshot is available only in a non-default location.  
  
2.  Run the [Replication Snapshot Agent](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Replication-Snapshot-Agent.md) from the command prompt or start the Snapshot Agent job to generate a new snapshot. For more information, see [Create and Apply the Initial Snapshot](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Create-and-Apply-the-Initial-Snapshot.md).  
  
## Example  
 This example creates a publication that uses an alternate snapshot folder and a compressed snapshot.
