|[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] is a platform for building enterprise-level data integration and data transformations solutions. You use [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] to solve complex business problems by copying or downloading files, sending e-mail messages in response to events, updating data warehouses, cleaning and mining data, and managing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] objects and data. The packages can work alone or in concert with other packages to address complex business needs. [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] can extract and transform data from a wide variety of sources such as XML data files, flat files, and relational data sources, and then load the data into one or more destinations.<br /><br /> [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] includes a rich set of built-in tasks and transformations; tools for constructing packages; and the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] service for running and managing packages. You can use the graphical [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] tools to create solutions without writing a single line of code; or you can program the extensive [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] object model to create packages programmatically and code custom tasks and other package objects.<br /><br /> **Browse Content by Area**<br /> ![Small File Folder Icon](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/media/filefolder_small.png "filefolder_small") [What's New](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/What-s-New-in-Integration-Services.md)<br /><br /> ![Small File Folder Icon](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/media/filefolder_small.png "filefolder_small") [Backward Compatibility](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Integration-Services-Backward-Compatibility.md)<br /><br /> ![Small File Folder Icon](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/media/filefolder_small.png "filefolder_small") [Integration Services Features and Tasks](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Integration-Services-Features-and-Tasks.md)<br /><br /> ![Small File Folder Icon](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/media/filefolder_small.png "filefolder_small") [Technical Reference](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Technical-Reference--Integration-Services-.md)|
