# Attribute Relationship Diagram (Attribute Relationship Designer Tab, Dimension Designer) (Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data)
  Use the pane immediately under the toolbar on the **Attribute Relationships** tab to view the attribute relationship diagram, and to create, modify, and delete attribute relationships.  
  
 **To view the pane that contains the attribute relationship diagram**  
  
-   In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)], in Solution Explorer, double\-click a dimension to open the Dimension Designer, and then click the **Attribute Relationship** tab.  
  
## Using the Attribute Relationship Diagram  
 Use the attribute relationship diagram to create, edit or delete attribute relationships. The attribute relationship diagram will also highlight problematic attribute relationships and display a description of the issue in a tooltip.  
  
 There are three separate shortcut menus available in the diagram: the diagram shortcut menu, the attribute shortcut menu, and the relationship shortcut menu.  
  
### Diagram Shortcut Menu  
 To open the shortcut menu for the attribute relationship diagram, right\-click the background of the diagram. The diagram shortcut menu has the following commands:  
  
 **New Attribute Relationship**  
 Opens the **Create Attribute Relationship** dialog box in which you can define a new attribute relationship.  
  
 For more information, see [Create Attribute Relationship and Edit Attribute Relationship Dialog Boxes &#40;Attribute Relationship Designer Tab, Dimension Designer&#41; &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](../Topic/Create%20Attribute%20Relationship%20and%20Edit%20Attribute%20Relationship%20Dialog%20Boxes%20\(Attribute%20Relationship%20Designer%20Tab,%20Dimension%20Designer\)%20\(Analysis%20Services%20-%20Multidimensional%20Data\).md) and [Define Attribute Relationships](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/Define-Attribute-Relationships.md).  
  
 **Arrange Shapes**

 **Expand All Shapes**  
 Displays the grouped attributes that are associated with the top\-level attributes. Grouped attributes are only visible when the shapes in the attribute relationship diagram are expanded.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you click this option, the Dimension Designer will return the shapes in the attribute relationship diagram back to the default layout that the designer uses.  
  
 **Collapse All Shapes**  
 Hides the grouped attributes that are associated with the top\-level attributes.

 **Zoom**

 **New Attribute Relationship**  
 Opens the **Create Attribute Relationship** dialog box in which you can define a new attribute relationship.

 **Edit Attribute Relationship**  
 Opens the **Edit Attribute Relationship** dialog box in which you can modify the attribute relationship.
