# Set Up an Encrypted Mirror Database
To enable automatic decryption of the database master key of a mirror database, you must provide the password used to encrypt the master key to the mirror server instance. [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssVersion2005_md.md)] and later versions include mechanisms to transfer the password. Use **sp_control_dbmasterkey_password** to create a credential for the database master key before you start database mirroring. You must repeat this process for every database that will be mirrored. For more information, see [sp_control_dbmasterkey_password (Transact-SQL)](assetId:///63979a87-42a2-446e-8e43-30481faaf3ca).  
  
> [!CAUTION]  
>  Do not enable failover decryption of a database that must remain inaccessible to **sa** and other highly privileged server principals. You can configure a database so that its key hierarchy cannot be decrypted by the service master key. This option is supported as a defense-in-depth for databases that contain information that should not be accessible to **sa** or other highly privileged server principals. Enabling failover decryption of such a database removes this defense-in-depth, enabling **sa** and other highly privileged server principals to decrypt the database.
