# Log File Viewer
Log File Viewer in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] is used to access information about errors and events that are captured in log files.  
  
## Benefits of using Log File Viewer  
 You can view [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] log files from a local or remote instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] when the target instance is offline or cannot start.
