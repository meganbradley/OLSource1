After you review the choices that you made in the wizard and click **Finish**, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Import and Export Wizard shows  **Performing Operation**. On this page, you see the progress and the result of the operations that you selected. For more info, see [Performing Operation (SQL Server Import and Export Wizard)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Performing-Operation--SQL-Server-Import-and-Export-Wizard-.md).
