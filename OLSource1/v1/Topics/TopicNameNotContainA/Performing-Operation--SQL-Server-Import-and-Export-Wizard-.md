# Performing Operation (SQL Server Import and Export Wizard)
  After you review the choices that you made in the wizard and click **Finish**, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Import and Export Wizard shows  **Performing Operation**.

For more info, see [Performing Operation \(SQL Server Import and Export Wizard\)](../Topic/Performing%20Operation%20\(SQL%20Server%20Import%20and%20Export%20Wizard\).md).

## What's next?  
 After the operations that you selected run and complete successfully, you're finished running the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Import and Export Wizard.  
  
-   If you ran the copy operation immediately, you can open the destination that you selected to review the data that the wizard copied.  
  
-   If you saved the SSIS package created by the wizard, you can open it in SQL Server Data Tools to customize it and reuse it. For info about how to customize and run the saved package, see [Save SSIS Package &#40;SQL Server Import and Export Wizard&#41;](Save%20SSIS%20Package%20\(SQL%20Server%20Import%20and%20Export%20Wizard\).md).
