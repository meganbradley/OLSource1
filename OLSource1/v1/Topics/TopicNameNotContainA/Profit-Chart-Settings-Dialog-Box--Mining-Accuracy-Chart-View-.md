# Profit Chart Settings Dialog Box (Mining Accuracy Chart View)
Use the **Profit Chart Settings** dialog box to configure settings for generating a profit chart. For more information about profit charts, see [Lift Chart (Analysis Services - Data Mining)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Lift-Chart--Analysis-Services---Data-Mining-.md).  
  
## Options
