# Preview Data Dialog Box (SQL Server Import and Export Wizard)
After you specify the data that you want to copy, you can optionally preview up to 200 rows of sample data in the **Preview Data** dialog box. This helps you to confirm that the wizard is going to copy the data that you want to copy.  
  
 For more info about the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Import and Export Wizard and how it works, see [SQL Server Import and Export Wizard](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/SQL-Server-Import-and-Export-Wizard.md).  
  
## Screen shot  
 The following screen shot shows the **Preview Data** dialog box of the Wizard.  
  
 ![Preview data page of the Import and Export Wizard](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/media/Preview-data.png "Preview)  
  
## Options on this page  
 **Source**  
 Displays the query that the wizard will send to the data source.  
  
 **Sample data grid**  
 Displays up to 200 rows of sample data that the query returned.  
  
## What's next?  
 After you preview the data that you're going to copy and click **OK**, the **Preview Data dialog** box returns you to the **Select Source Tables and Views** page or the **Configure Flat File Destination** page. For more info, see [Select Source Tables and Views (SQL Server Import and Export Wizard)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Select-Source-Tables-and-Views--SQL-Server-Import-and-Export-Wizard-.md) or [Configure Flat File Destination (SQL Server Import and Export Wizard)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Configure-Flat-File-Destination--SQL-Server-Import-and-Export-Wizard-.md).  
  
 After you preview the data, you may want to change the options that you selected on previous pages of the wizard. To make these changes, on the **Select Source Tables and Views** page, click **Back** to return to previous pages where you can change your selections.
