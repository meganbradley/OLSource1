# Alignment Dialog Box for Text and Placeholders (Report Builder and SSRS)
Select the **Alignment** tab to position the values within a selected cell or data region. You can only format the horizontal alignment of individual text within a text box. If you would like to set padding values on the text box or how text is aligned vertically, use the corresponding text box properties. For more information, see [Text Box Properties Dialog Box, Alignment (Report Builder and SSRS)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Text-Box-Properties-Dialog-Box--Alignment--Report-Builder-and-SSRS-.md).  
  
## Options  
 **Horizontal**  
 Specify a value or type an expression that evaluates to the position where the text is positioned horizontally within a selected cell or data region. Click the **Expression** (*fx*) button to edit the expression.  
  
-   **General** Display the text as calculated by [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)]. For more information about how general text alignment is calculated, see [Formatting Text and Placeholders (Report Builder and SSRS)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Formatting-Text-and-Placeholders--Report-Builder-and-SSRS-.md).  
  
-   **Left** Display the text as aligned to the left.  
  
-   **Center** Display the text as aligned in the center.  
  
-   **Right** Display the text as aligned to the right.
