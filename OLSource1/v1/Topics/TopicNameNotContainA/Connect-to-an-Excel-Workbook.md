# Connect to an Excel Workbook
  To connect an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssISnoversion_md.md)] package to a Microsoft Office Excel workbook requires anÂ Excel connection manager.  
  
 You can create these connection managers from either the Connection Managers area in [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../Token\Other/ssIS_md.md)] Designer or from the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Import and Export Wizard.  
  
 **Providers and drivers for Microsoft Excel and Access files**  
  
 You may have to download the OLE DB providers and drivers for Microsoft Office files if they're not already installed. Later versions of the provider can open files created by earlier versions of Excel.  
  
 If the computer has a 32\-bit version of Office, then you have to install the 32\-bit version of the drivers, and you also have to ensure that you run the wizard or the Integration Services package that it creates in 32\-bit mode.
