# Reporting Services (SSRS)
  Create, deploy, and manage mobile and paginated reports for your organization, with the range of ready\-to\-use tools and services that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] provides.  
  
 See [What's New in Reporting Services &#40;SSRS&#41;](../Topic/What's%20New%20in%20Reporting%20Services%20\(SSRS\).md) for more about new features in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Token\Other/ssCurrent_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssRSnoversion_md.md)].

## Report design  
 Reports can be mobile, paginated, interactive, tabular, and graphical, with a variety of data, including relational, multidimensional, and XML\-based data sources. Reports can include rich data visualizations, including charts, maps, sparklines, and KPIs.  
  
 You can design:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] paginated reports within the Microsoft Visual Studio environment, fully integrated with SQL Server tools and components.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] paginated reports in the standalone Report Builder app.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] mobile reports in the Mobile Report Publisher.  
  
## [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] programming features  
 Take advantage of [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] programming features so you can  extend and customize your reporting functionality, with APIs to integrate or extend data and report processing in custom applications.  
  
## Server\-based reporting platform  
 [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] is a server\-based reporting platform. You publish reports to a report server, or as part of a Microsoft Windows application, or to a SharePoint site. You can schedule report processing, access reports on\-demand, subscribe to published reports, and export reports to other applications such as Microsoft Excel. Create data alerts on reports published to a SharePoint site and receive email messages when report data changes.  
  
 You can select from a variety of viewing formats. You can view [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] mobile reports in the Power BI app for mobile devices. The reports that you create can be viewed over a Web\-based connection.
