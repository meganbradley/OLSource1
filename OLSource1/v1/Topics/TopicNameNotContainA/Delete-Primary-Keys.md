# Delete Primary Keys
You can delete (drop) a primary key in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/tsql_md.md)]. When the primary key is deleted, the corresponding index is deleted.

#### To delete a primary key constraint using Object Explorer  
  
1.  In Object Explorer, expand the table that contains the primary key and then expand **Keys**.  
  
2.  Right-click the key and select **Delete**.  
  
3.  In the **Delete Object** dialog box, verify the correct key is specified and click **OK**.  
  
#### To delete a primary key constraint using Table Designer  
  
1.  In Object Explorer, right-click the table with the primary key, and click **Design**.  
  
2.  In the table grid, right-click the row with the primary key and choose **Remove Primary Key** to toggle the setting from on to off.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  To undo this action, close the table without saving the changes. Deleting a primary key cannot be undone without losing all other changes made to the table.  
  
3.  On the **File** menu, click **Save***table name*.  
  
##  <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a> Using Transact-SQL  
  
#### To delete a primary key constraint  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)].  
  
2.  On the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**. The example first identifies the name of the primary key constraint and then deletes the constraint.  
  
    ```  
    USE AdventureWorks2012;  
    GO  
    -- Return the name of primary key.  
    SELECT name  
    FROM sys.key_constraints  
    WHERE type = 'PK' AND OBJECT_NAME(parent_object_id) = N'TransactionHistoryArchive';  
    GO  
    -- Delete the primary key constraint.  
    ALTER TABLE Production.TransactionHistoryArchive  
    DROP CONSTRAINT PK_TransactionHistoryArchive_TransactionID;   
    GO  
    ```
