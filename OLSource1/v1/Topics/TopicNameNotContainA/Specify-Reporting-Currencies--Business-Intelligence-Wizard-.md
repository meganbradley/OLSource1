# Specify Reporting Currencies (Business Intelligence Wizard)
  Use the **Define Reporting Currencies** page to define the reporting currencies for currency conversion functionality that covers the many\-to\-many or one\-to\-many conversion type specified on the **Select Conversion Type** page. \(A reporting currency is the currency in which the values for measures selected on the **Select Measures** page are converted.\) The selected members from the currency dimension define a reporting currency dimension for the currency conversion generated by the Business Intelligence Wizard.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This page does not appear if the Business Intelligence Wizard was started from Dimension Designer or by right\-clicking a dimension in Solution Explorer in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)]. This page also does not appear if **Many\-to\-One** was selected on the **Select Conversion Type** page.  
  
## Options

 Select **Reporting currencies** to include all listed members from the currency dimension in the reporting currency dimension. Clear **Reporting currencies** to exclude all listed members.
