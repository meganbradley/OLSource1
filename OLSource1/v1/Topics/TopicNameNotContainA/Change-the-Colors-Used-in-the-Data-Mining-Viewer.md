# Change the Colors Used in the Data Mining Viewer
  You can change the colors that are used in the data mining viewers to display data series, nodes, or clusters. You do this by setting options in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssManStudioFull_md.md)]. After you have changed the settings, the color selections apply to all models that you view by using [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)]; however, you must close [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)] and reopen the model in the viewer to see the new colors.  
  
### To change the colors used in the data mining viewers  
  
1.  On the **Tools** menu of [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssManStudioFull_md.md)], select **Options**.  
  
2.  In the **Options** dialog box, expand **Designers**, and then expand **Data Mining Viewers**.  
  
3.  Find the viewer property that you want to change, and click the current color selection.  
  
4.  Select a new color from the dropdown list. Click the **Custom** tab to select a color from the palette of custom colors available on the current computer, or click **System** to select a color from among the colors specified in the Windows color scheme.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you use a custom color, the color is represented by a color icon and the RBG values of the color. If you use a System color or Web color, the color is represented by a color icon and the name of the color.
