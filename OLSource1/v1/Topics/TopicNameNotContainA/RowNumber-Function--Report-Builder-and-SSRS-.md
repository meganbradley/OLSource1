# RowNumber Function (Report Builder and SSRS)
Returns a running count of the number of rows for the specified scope.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  [!INCLUDE[ssRBRDDup](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRBRDDup_md.md)]  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
RowNumber(scope)  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *scope*  
 (**String**) The name of a dataset, data region, or group, or null (**Nothing** in [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/vbprvb_md.md)]), that specifies the context in which to evaluate the number of rows. **Nothing** specifies the outermost context, usually the report dataset.  
  
## Remarks  
 **RowNumber** returns a running value of the count of rows within the specified scope, just as [RunningValue](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/RunningValue-Function--Report-Builder-and-SSRS-.md) returns the running value of an aggregate function. When you specify a scope, you specify when to reset the row count to 1.  
  
 *scope* cannot be an expression. *scope* must be a containing scope. Typical scopes, from the outermost to the innermost containment, are report dataset, data region, row groups or column groups.  
  
 To increment values across columns, specify a scope that is the name of a column group. To increment numbers down rows, specify a scope that is the name of a row group.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Including aggregates that specify both a row group and a column group in a single expression is not supported.  
  
 For more information, see [Aggregate Functions Reference (Report Builder and SSRS)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Aggregate-Functions-Reference--Report-Builder-and-SSRS-.md) and [Expression Scope for Totals, Aggregates, and Built-in Collections (Report Builder and SSRS)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Expression-Scope-for-Totals--Aggregates--and-Built-in-Collections--Report-Builder-and-SSRS-.md).  
  
## Code Example  
 The following is an expression that you can use for the **BackgroundColor** property of a Tablix data region detail row to alternate the color of detail rows for each group, always beginning with White.  
  
```  
=IIF(RowNumber("GroupbyCategory") Mod 2, "White", "PaleGreen")  
```
