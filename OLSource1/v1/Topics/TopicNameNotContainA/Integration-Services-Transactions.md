# Integration Services Transactions
Packages use transactions to bind the database actions that tasks perform into atomic units, and by doing this maintain data integrity. All [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] container types—packages, the For Loop, Foreach Loop, and Sequence containers, and the task hosts that encapsulate each task—can be configured to use transactions. [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] provides three options for configuring transactions: **NotSupported**, **Supported**, and **Required**.  
  
-   **Required** indicates that the container starts a transaction, unless one is already started by its parent container. If a transaction already exists, the container joins the transaction. For example, if a package that is not configured to support transactions includes a Sequence container that uses the **Required** option, the Sequence container would start its own transaction. If the package were configured to use the **Required** option, the Sequence container would join the package transaction.  
  
-   **Supported** indicates that the container does not start a transaction, but joins any transaction started by its parent container. For example, if a package with four Execute SQL tasks starts a transaction and all four tasks use the **Supported** option, the database updates performed by the Execute SQL tasks are rolled back if any task fails. If the package does not start a transaction, the four Execute SQL tasks are not bound by a transaction, and no database updates except the ones performed by the failed task are rolled back.  
  
-   **NotSupported** indicates that the container does not start a transaction or join an existing transaction. A transaction started by a parent container does not affect child containers that have been configured to not support transactions. For example, if a package is configured to start a transaction and a For Loop container in the package uses the **NotSupported** option, none of the tasks in the For Loop can roll back if they fail.  
  
 You configure transactions by setting the **TransactionOption** property on the container. You can set this property by using the **Properties** window in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)], or you can set the property programmatically.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The **TransactionOption** property influences whether or not the value of the **IsolationLevel** property requested by a container is applied. For more information, see the description of the **IsolationLevel** property in the topic, [Setting Package Properties](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Set-Package-Properties.md).
