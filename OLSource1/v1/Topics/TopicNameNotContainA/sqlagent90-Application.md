# sqlagent90 Application
The **sqlagent90** application starts [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent from the command prompt. Usually, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent should be run from [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] or by using SQL-SMO methods in an application. Only run **sqlagent90** from the command prompt when you are diagnosing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent, or when you are directed to it by your primary support provider.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sqlagent90  
-c [-v] [-i instance_name]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 **-c**  
 Indicates that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent is running from the command prompt and is independent of the Microsoft Windows Services Control Manager. When **-c** is used, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent cannot be controlled from either the Services application in Administrative Tools or [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Configuration Manager. This argument is mandatory.  
  
 **-v**  
 Indicates that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent runs in verbose mode and writes diagnostic information to the command-prompt window. The diagnostic information is the same as the information written to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent error log.  
  
 **-i** *instance_name*  
 Indicates that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent connects to the named [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] instance specified by *instance_name*.  
  
## Remarks  
 After displaying a copyright message, **sqlagent90** displays output in the command prompt window only when the **-v** switch is specified. To stop **sqlagent90**, press CTRL+C at the command prompt. Do not close the command-prompt window before stopping **sqlagent90**.
