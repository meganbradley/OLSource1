# Placeholder Properties Dialog Box, General (Report Builder and SSRS)
  Use the **Placeholder Properties** dialog box to change the value, ToolTip, and markup options of a placeholder in a text box.  
  
## Options  
 **Label**  
 Type a label for the placeholder. The label is displayed on the design surface only.  
  
 **Value**  
 Type the value of the text box. This should be a field expression, other expression, or a label. Click the **Expression** \(*fx*\) button to edit the expression.  
  
 **Tooltip**  
 Type text or an expression that evaluates to a ToolTip. Click the **Expression** \(*fx*\) button to edit the expression. The ToolTip appears when the user pauses the pointer over the item in the rendered report.  
  
 **Markup type**  
 Select an option to indicate how the placeholder is rendered.  
  
-   **Plain Text** Display the placeholder as simple text. HTML is treated as literal text.  
  
-   **HTML**  Display the placeholder as HTML. If the expression value of the placeholder contains valid HTML tags, these tags are rendered as HTML.
