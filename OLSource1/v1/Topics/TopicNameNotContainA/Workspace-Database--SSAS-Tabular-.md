# Workspace Database (SSAS Tabular)
The tabular model workspace database, used during model authoring, is created when you create a new tabular model project in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)]. The workspace database resides in-memory on an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] instance running in Tabular mode; typically on the same computer as [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudio](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudio_md.md)].  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The model's compatibility level and the Workspace Server must correspond. For Tabular models at **SQL Server 2016 RTM (1200)** compatibility level, the Workspace Server must be a [!INCLUDE[ssASCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASCurrent_md.md)] tabular instance.

##  <a name="bkmk_overview"></a> Workspace Database Overview  
 A workspace database is created on the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] instance, specified in the Workspace Server property, when you create a new Business Intelligence project by using one of the tabular model project templates in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudio](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudio_md.md)]. Each tabular model project will have its own workspace database. You can use [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] to view the workspace database on the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] server. The workspace database name includes the project name, followed by an underscore, followed by the username, followed by an underscore, followed by a GUID.  
  
 The workspace database resides in-memory while the tabular model project is open in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudio](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudio_md.md)]. When you close the project, the workspace database is either kept in-memory, stored to disk and removed from memory (default), or removed from memory and not stored on disk, as determined by the Workspace Retention property. For more information about the Workspace Retention property, see [Workspace Database Properties](#bkmk_ws_prop) later in this topic.  
  
 After you have added data to your model project by using the Table Import Wizard or by using copy/paste, when you view the tables, columns, and data in the model designer, you are viewing the workspace database. If you add additional tables, columns, relationships, etc. you are changing the workspace database.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If any of the tables in your model will contain a large number of rows, consider importing only a subset of the data during model authoring. By importing a subset of the data, you can reduce processing time and consumption of workspace database server resources.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The preview window in the Select Tables and Views page in the Table Import Wizard, Edit Table Properties dialog box, and Partition Manager dialog box show tables, columns, and rows at the data source, and may not show the same tables, columns, and rows as the workspace database.  
  
 When you deploy a tabular model project, the deployed model database, which is essentially a copy of the workspace database, is created on the Analysis Services server instance specified in the Deployment Server property. For more information about the Deployment Server property, see [Project Properties (SSAS Tabular)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Project-Properties--SSAS-Tabular-.md).  
  
 The model workspace database typically resides on localhost or a local named instance of an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] server. You can use a remote instance of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] to host the workspace database, however, this configuration is not recommended due to latency during data queries and other restrictions. Optimally, the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] that will host the workspace databases is on the same computer as [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudio](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudio_md.md)]. Authoring model projects on the same computer as the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] instance that hosts the workspace database can improve performance.  
  
 Remote workspace databases have the following restrictions:  
  
-   Potential latency during queries.  
  
-   The Data Backup property cannot be set to **Backup to disk**.  
  
-   You cannot import data from a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssGemini_md.md)] workbook when creating a new tabular model project by using the Import from [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssGemini_md.md)] project template.  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_ws_prop"></a> Workspace Database Properties  
 Workspace database properties are included in the model properties. To view model properties, in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudio](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudio_md.md)], in **Solution Explorer**, click the **Model.bim** file. Model properties can be configured using the **Properties** window. Workspace database specific properties include:  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  **Workspace Server**, **Workspace Retention**, and **Data Backup** properties have default settings applied when you create a new model project. You can change the default settings for new model projects on the **Data Modeling** page in **Analysis Server** settings in the Tools\Options dialog box. These properties, as well as others, can also be set for each model project in the **Properties** window. Changing default settings will not apply to model projects already created. For more information, see [Configure Default Data Modeling and Deployment Properties (SSAS Tabular)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Configure-Default-Data-Modeling-and-Deployment-Properties--SSAS-Tabular-.md).  
  
|Property|Default Setting|Description|  
|--------------|---------------------|-----------------|  
|**Workspace Database**|The project name, followed by an underscore, followed by the username, followed by an underscore, followed by a GUID.|The name of the workspace database used for storing and editing the in-memory model project. After a tabular model project is created, this database will appear in the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] instance specified in the **Workspace Server** property. This property cannot be set in the Properties window.|  
|**Workspace Retention**|Unload in memory|Specifies how a workspace database is retained after a model project is closed. A workspace database includes model metadata and imported data. In some cases, the workspace database can be very large and consume a large amount of memory. By default, when you close a model project in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudio](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudio_md.md)], the workspace database is unloaded from memory. When changing this setting it is important to consider your available memory resources as well as how often you plan to work on the model project. This property setting has the following options:<br /><br /> **Keep in memory** - Specifies to keep the workspace database in memory after a model project is closed. This option will consume more memory; however, when opening a model project in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudio](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudio_md.md)], fewer resources are consumed and the workspace database will load faster.<br /><br /> **Unload from memory** - Specifies to keep the workspace database on disk, but no longer in memory after a model project is closed. This option will consume less memory; however, when opening a model project in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudio](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudio_md.md)], the workspace database must be re-attached; additional resources are consumed and the model project will load more slowly than if the workspace database is kept in memory. Use this option when in-memory resources are limited or when working on a remote workspace database.<br /><br /> **Delete workspace** - Specifies to delete the workspace database from memory and not keep the workspace database on disk after the model project is closed. This option will consume less memory and storage space; however, when opening a model project in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudio](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudio_md.md)], additional resources are consumed and the model project will load more slowly than if the workspace database is kept in memory or on-disk. Use this option when only occasionally working on model projects.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> The default setting for this property can be changed on the **Data Modeling** page in **Analysis Server** settings in the Tools\Options dialog box.|  
|**Workspace Server**|localhost|This property specifies the default server that will be used to host the workspace database while the model project is being authored in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudio](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudio_md.md)]. All available instances of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] running on the local computer are included in the listbox.<br /><br /> To specify a different [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] server (running in Tabular mode), type the server name. The user logged on must be an Administrator on the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] server.<br /><br /> Note that It is recommended you specify a local [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] server as the workspace server. For workspace databases on a remote server, importing from [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssGemini_md.md)] is not supported, data cannot be backed up locally, and the user interface may experience latency during queries.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> The default setting for this property can be changed on the Data Modeling page in [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] settings in the Tools\Options dialog box.|  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_use_ssms"></a> Using SSMS to Manage the Workspace Database  
 You can use [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] (SSMS) to connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] server that hosts the workspace database. Typically, there is no management of the workspace database necessary; the exception, is to detach or delete a workspace database, which must be done from [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)].  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] is available as a free web download. See [Download SQL Server Management Studio](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt238290.aspx) for more information.  
  
> [!WARNING]  
>  Do not use [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] to manage the workspace database while the project is open in the model designer. Doing so could lead to data loss.
