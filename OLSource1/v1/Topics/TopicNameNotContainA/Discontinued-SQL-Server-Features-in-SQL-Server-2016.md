# Discontinued SQL Server Features in SQL Server 2016
  This topic describes features that are no longer available after you upgrade to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Token\Other/ssCurrent_md.md)].

 [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../Token\Other/ssSQL15_md.md)] is a 64\-bit application. 32\-bit installation is discontinued, though some elements run as 32\-bit components.
