  This topic describes how to delete \(drop\) an index in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Token\Other/ssCurrent_md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Token\Other/tsql_md.md)].

###  <a name="Restrictions"></a> Limitations and Restrictions  
 Indexes created as the result of a PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraint cannot be deleted by using this method. Instead, the constraint must be deleted. To remove the constraint and corresponding index, use [ALTER TABLE](../Topic/ALTER%20TABLE%20\(Transact-SQL\).md) with the DROP CONSTRAINT clause in [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Token\Other/tsql_md.md)]. For more information, see [Delete Primary Keys](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/Delete-Primary-Keys.md).

 Requires ALTER permission on the table or view. This permission is granted by default to the **sysadmin** fixed server role and the **db\_ddladmin** and **db\_owner** fixed database roles.
