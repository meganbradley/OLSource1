# Approval Required (Master Data Services)
In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)], the administrator can set an entity to Approval Required. All the changes on this entity would require one of the entity administrators to review and approve the changes.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Changes made on leaf members requires approval. The changes made on deprecated explicit hierarchies and collections  bypass the approval.  
>   
>  Changes made by the staging table process bypass the approval.  
>   
>  Changes made by a business rule bypass the approval.
