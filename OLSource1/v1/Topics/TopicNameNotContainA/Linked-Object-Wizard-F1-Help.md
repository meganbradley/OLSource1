# Linked Object Wizard F1 Help
Use the Linked Object Wizard to link to or import from objects in other [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] databases, from either the same [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] instance, or from another instance, to the current [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] project in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)]. Linked objects continue to reflect changes in their source [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] database, while imported objects do not reflect changes made to their source database. Dimensions and measure groups, including their associated measures, can be linked. Actions, key performance indicators (KPIs), and calculations can be imported.  
  
 The Linked Object Wizard guides you through the following steps:  
  
-   Selecting the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] data source from which to link or import objects.  
  
-   Selecting the objects from which to link or import.  
  
-   Saving the changes.
