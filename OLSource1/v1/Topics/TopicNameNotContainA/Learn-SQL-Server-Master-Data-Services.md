# Learn SQL Server Master Data Services
  
  
## Training  
* To explore the new features and capabilities introduced in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent_md](../../Token\Other/ssCurrent_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort_md](../../Token\Other/ssMDSshort_md.md)],try out this [**TechNet virtual lab**](https://vlabs.holsystems.com/vlabs/technet?eng=VLabs&amp;auth=none&amp;src=vlabs&amp;altadd=true&amp;labid=23113&amp;lod=true) (sign-in with your Microsoft account is required).  
* To develop a [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort_md](../../Token\Other/ssMDSshort_md.md)] solution to store and manage master lists of geographic data, using the Add-in for Excel and the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm_md](../../Token\Other/ssMDSmdm_md.md)], try out this [**TechNet virtual lab**](https://vlabs.holsystems.com/vlabs/technet?eng=VLabs&amp;auth=none&amp;src=vlabs&amp;altadd=true&amp;labid=23112&amp;lod=true). You'll create entities and hierarchies, and use [!INCLUDE[ssIS_md](../../Token\Other/ssIS_md.md)] to populate a dimension table.  
  
## Videos  
* To view demonstrations of the entity sync feature, enhancements to derived hierarchies, and other great [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort_md](../../Token\Other/ssMDSshort_md.md)] features, [**watch this video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lQSc-eLkvk).  
* To learn about the new capabilities in the [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent_md](../../Token\Other/ssCurrent_md.md)] release of [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort_md](../../Token\Other/ssMDSshort_md.md)], [**watch this video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKA72FpOVxI).  
  
## Samples  
* To learn more about how you can structure data in [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort_md](../../Token\Other/ssMDSshort_md.md)] using models, entities, and hierarchies, try out the sample models that are included when you install [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort_md](../../Token\Other/ssMDSshort_md.md)]. For instructions on deploying the samples, see  [Deploy Sample Models and Data](Master%20Data%20Services.md\#deploySample).   
  
	For information about the [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent_md](../../Token\Other/ssCurrent_md.md)] updates to the sample models, see [Samples: Model Deployment Packages](Samples%3a%20Model%20Deployment%20Packages%20%28Master%20Data%20Services%29.xml).  
  
* For a demonstration of how to customize the way that you and your users interact with [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort_md](../../Token\Other/ssMDSshort_md.md)], try out the MDS C# console application samples that are included with the SQL Server samples. You can download the SQL Server samples as a .zip file from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples).  
  
	The following are the MDS application samples. The SQL Server samples download also includes 	readmes that help you get started using the application samples.  
	* Master Data Services Business Rule API Sample  
	* Master Data Services Entity Based Staging API Sample  
	* Master Data Services Master Data API Sample  
	* Master Data Services Metadata API Sample  
	* Master Data Services Security Model Deployment API Sample
