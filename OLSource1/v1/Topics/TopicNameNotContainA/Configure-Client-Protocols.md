# Configure Client Protocols
This topic describes how to configure client protocols used by client applications in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Configuration Manager. Microsoft [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] supports client communication with the TCP/IP network protocol and the named pipes protocol. The shared memory protocol is also available if the client is connecting to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)] on the same computer. There are three common methods of selecting the protocol.  
  
-   Configure all client applications to use the same network protocol by setting the protocol order in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Configuration Manager.  
  
-   Configure a single client application to use a different network protocol by creating an alias. For more information, see [Create or Delete a Server Alias for Use by a Client (SQL Server Configuration Manager)](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Create-or-Delete-a-Server-Alias-for-Use-by-a-Client--SQL-Server-Configuration-Manager-.md).  
  
-   Some client applications, such as sqlcmd.exe, can specify the protocol as part of the connection string. For more information, see [Connect to the Database Engine With sqlcmd](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Connect-to-the-Database-Engine-With-sqlcmd.md).  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Configuration Manager  
  
###  <a name="EnableDisable"></a> To enable or disable a client protocol  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Configuration Manager, expand **SQL Server Native Client Configuration**, right-click **Client Protocols**, and then click **Properties**.  
  
2.  Click a protocol in the **Disabled Protocols** box, and then click **Enable**, to enable a protocol.  
  
3.  Click a protocol in the **Enabled Protocols** box, and then click **Disable**, to disable a protocol.  
  
###  <a name="ChangeDefault"></a> To change the default protocol or the protocol order for client computers  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Configuration Manager, expand **SQL Server Native Client Configuration**, right-click **Client Protocols**, and then click **Properties**.  
  
2.  In the **Enabled Protocols** box, click **Move Up** or **Move Down**, to change the order in which protocols are tried, when attempting to connect to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)]. The top protocol in the **Enabled Protocols** box is the default protocol.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Configuration Manager creates registry entries for the server alias configurations and default client network library. However, the application does not install either the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] client network libraries or the network protocols. The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] client network libraries are installed during [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Setup; the network protocols are installed as part of Microsoft Windows Setup (or through **Networks** in **Control Panel**). A particular network protocol may not be available as part of Windows Setup. For more information about installing these network protocols, see the vendor documentation.  
  
###  <a name="Configure"></a> To configure a client to use TCP/IP  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Configuration Manager, expand **SQL Server Native Client Configuration**, right-click **Client Protocols**, and then click **Properties**.  
  
2.  In the **Enabled Protocols** box, click the up and down arrows to change the order in which protocols are tried, when attempting to connect to SQL Server. The top protocol in the **Enabled Protocols** box is the default protocol.  
  
 The shared memory protocol is enabled separately by checking the **Enabled Shared Memory Protocol** box.
