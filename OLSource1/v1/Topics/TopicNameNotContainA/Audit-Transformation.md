# Audit Transformation
The Audit transformation enables the data flow in a package to include data about the environment in which the package runs. For example, the name of the package, computer, and operator can be added to the data flow. [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] includes system variables that provide this information.  
  
## System Variables  
 The following table describes the system variables that the Audit transformation can use.  
  
|System variable|Index|Description|  
|---------------------|-----------|-----------------|  
|**ExecutionInstanceGUID**|0|The GUID that identifies the execution instance of the package.|  
|**PackageID**|1|The unique identifier of the package.|  
|**PackageName**|2|The package name.|  
|**VersionID**|3|The version of the package.|  
|**ExecutionStartTime**|4|The time the package started to run.|  
|**MachineName**|5|The computer name.|  
|**UserName**|6|The login name of the person who started the package.|  
|**TaskName**|7|The name of the Data Flow task with which the Audit transformation is associated.|  
|**TaskId**|8|The unique identifier of the Data Flow task.|  
  
## Configuration of the Audit Transformation  
 You configure the Audit transformation by providing the name of a new output column to add to the transformation output, and then mapping the system variable to the output column. You can map a single system variable to multiple columns.  
  
 This transformation has one input and one output. It does not support an error output.  
  
 You can set properties through [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssIS_md.md)] Designer or programmatically.  
  
 For more information about the properties that you can set in the **Audit Transformation Editor** dialog box, see [Audit Transformation Editor](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Audit-Transformation-Editor.md).  
  
 The **Advanced Editor** dialog box reflects the properties that can be set programmatically. For more information about the properties that you can set in the **Advanced Editor** dialog box or programmatically, click one of the following topics:
