# Event Handlers Tab
  Use the **Event Handlers** tab of [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../Token\Other/ssIS_md.md)] Designer to build a control flow in an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssISnoversion_md.md)] package. An event handler runs in response to an event raised by the package or by a task or container in the package.  
  
## Options  
 **Executable**  
 Select the executable for which you want to build an event handler. The executable can be the package, or a task or containers in the package.  
  
 **Event handler**  
 Select a type of event handler. Create the event handler by dragging items from the **Toolbox**.  
  
 **Delete**  
 Select an event handler, and remove it from the package by clicking **Delete**.  
  
 **Click here to create an \<event handler name\> for the executable \<executable name\>**  
 Click to create the event handler.  
  
 Create the control flow by dragging graphical objects that represent [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../Token\Other/ssIS_md.md)] tasks and containers from the **Toolbox** to the design surface of the **Event Handlers** tab, and then connecting the objects by using precedence constraints to define the sequence in which they run.  
  
 Additionally, to add annotations, right\-click the design surface, and then on the menu, click **Add Annotation**.
