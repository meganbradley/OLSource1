# Installation Type
Use the Installation Type page of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Installation Wizard to specify whether to install a new instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)], or add features to an existing instance.  
  
## Options  
 Select the radio button that specifies your choice:  
  
-   Perform a new installation of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)]  
  
-   Add features to an existing instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)]  
  
     If you select the option to add features to an existing instance, use the drop-down list to select the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] to update.  
  
 You can only add the SysPrep supported features—[!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)]—to a prepared image of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)]. Other features that are not supported by SysPrep can be added after the prepared instance is completed.  
  
 **Note** You cannot add features to a failover cluster instance after it is installed. To add [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] features to an existing failover cluster, you must perform a new installation to install a separate instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)].
