# set working set size Server Configuration Option
This option is still present in the **sp_configure** stored procedure, but its functionality is unavailable in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)]. (The setting has no effect.)
