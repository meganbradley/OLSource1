# Queue Reader Agent Security
The **Queue Reader Agent Security** dialog box allows you to specify the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] Windows account under which the Queue Reader Agent runs and makes local connections to the Distributor. The agent connects to the Publisher using the account specified in the **Publisher Properties** dialog box (available from the **Distributor Properties** dialog box); the agent connects to the Subscriber using the same context as the Distribution Agent for the subscription. For more information, see [View and Modify Replication Security Settings](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/View-and-Modify-Replication-Security-Settings.md).  
  
 The account must be valid with the correct password specified. Accounts and passwords are not validated until an agent runs.  
  
## Options  
 **Process account**  
 Enter a Windows account under which the Queue Reader Agent runs at the Distributor. The Windows account you specify must at minimum be a member of the **db_owner** fixed database role in the distribution database.  
  
 **Password** and **Confirm password**  
 Enter the password for the Windows account.
