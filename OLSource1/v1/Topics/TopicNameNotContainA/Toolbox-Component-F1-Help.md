# Toolbox Component F1 Help
**Toolbox** displays a variety of items for use in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] projects. You can open the **Toolbox** from the **View** menu, and dock this window as you wish. While docked, the **Toolbox** can either be pinned open or set to **Auto Hide** when not in use.  
  
 **Toolbox** items can be dragged and dropped or copied and pasted into code editors or onto design view surfaces within [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)].  
  
## How the Toolbox works  
 The Toolbox is a sliding tree control that behaves much like [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] Windows Explorer, but without grid or connection lines. Multiple segments of the **Toolbox** (called "tabs") can be expanded simultaneously, and the entire tree scrolls inside the **Toolbox** window. To expand any tab of the **Toolbox**, click the plus (**+**) sign next to its name. To collapse an expanded tab, click the minus (**-**) sign next to its name.  
  
 Each time you return to an editor or designer, the **Toolbox** automatically scrolls to the most recent tab and item selected. As you shift focus to a different editor or designer, the current selection in the **Toolbox** shifts with you.  
  
## Customize the Toolbox  
 It is easy to rearrange items within a tab, and to add custom tabs and items to the **Toolbox**.  
  
 To add or remove **Toolbox** items, on the **Tools** menu, click **Choose Toolbox Items**. Only **Maintenance Tasks** can be made available as **Toolbox** icons. All components are not always available. For instance, maintenance tasks are only available when creating a maintenance plan.  
  
## Add Azure components to the Toolbox  
 The Azure Feature Pack for Integration Services contains connection managers to connect to Azure data sources and tasks to do common Azure operations. Install the Feature Pack to add these items to the Toolbox. For more info, see [Azure Feature Pack for Integration Services (SSIS)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Azure-Feature-Pack-for-Integration-Services--SSIS-.md).
