# Discontinued Master Data Services Features
This topic describes [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)] features that are no longer available in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)].  
  
## [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] Discontinued Features  
 The [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssKilimanjaro_md.md)] staging process is removed in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)]. You should use the entity based staging process to import and modify data. For more information, see [Overview: Importing Data from Tables (Master Data Services)](../Topic/Overview:%20Importing%20Data%20from%20Tables%20\(Master%20Data%20Services\).md).  
  
 The Metadata model is no longer available. You can also no longer view metadata in the Explorer functional area.
