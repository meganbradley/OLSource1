# Logging In to SQL Server
You can log in to an instance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] by using any of the graphical administration tools or from a command prompt.  
  
 When you log in to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] by using a graphical administration tool such as [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)], you are prompted to supply the server name, a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] login, and a password, if necessary. If you log in to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] using Windows Authentication, you do not have to provide a SQL Server login each time you access an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)]. Instead, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] uses your [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] Windows account to log you in automatically. If [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] is running in mixed mode authentication ([!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] and Windows Authentication Mode), and you choose to log in using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Authentication, you must provide a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] login and password. When possible, use Windows Authentication.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you selected a case-sensitive collation when you installed [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)], your [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] login is also case sensitive.  
  
## Format for Specifying the Name of SQL Server  
 When connecting to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)] you must specify the name of the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)]. If the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] is the default instance (an unnamed instance), then specify the name of the computer where [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] is installed, or the IP address of the computer. If the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] is a named instance (such as SQLEXPRESS), then specify the name of the computer where [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] is installed, or the IP address of the computer, and add a slash and the instance name.  
  
 The following examples connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] running on a computer named APPHOST. When specifying a named instance, the examples use an instance name SQLEXPRESS.  
  
 **Examples:**  
  
|Type of Instance|Entry for the server name|  
|----------------------|-------------------------------|  
|Connection to a default instance using the default protocol. (This is the recommended entry for a default instance.)|APPHOST|  
|Connection to a named instance using the default protocol. (This is the recommended entry for a named instance.)|APPHOST\SQLEXPRESS|  
|Connection to a default instance on the same computer using a period to indicate that the instance is running on the local computer.|.|  
|Connection to a named instance on the same computer using a period to indicate that the instance is running on the local computer.|.\SQLEXPRESS|  
|Connection to a default instance on the same computer using localhost to indicate that the instance is running on the local computer.|localhost|  
|Connection to a named instance on the same computer using localhost to indicate that the instance is running on the local computer.|localhost\SQLEXPRESS|  
|Connection to a default instance on the same computer using (local) to indicate that the instance is running on the local computer.|(local)|  
|Connection to a named instance on the same computer using (local) to indicate that the instance is running on the local computer.|(local)\SQLEXPRESS|  
|Connection to a default instance on the same computer forcing a shared memory connection.|lpc:APPHOST|  
|Connection to a named instance on the same computer forcing a shared memory connection.|lpc:APPHOST\SQLEXPRESS|  
|Connection to a default instance listening on TCP address 192.168.17.28 using an IP address.|192.168.17.28|  
|Connection to a named instance listening on TCP address 192.168.17.28 using an IP address.|192.168.17.28\SQLEXPRESS|  
|Connection to a default instance that is not listening on the default TCP port, by specifying the port that is being used, in this case 2828. (This is not necessary if the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)] is listening on the default port (1433).)|APPHOST,2828|  
|Connection to a named instance on a designated TCP port, in this case 2828. (This is often necessary if the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Browser service is not running on the host computer.)|APPHOST,2828|  
|Connection to a default instance that is not listening on the default TCP port, by specifying both the IP address and the TCP port that is being used, in this case 2828.|192.168.17.28,2828|  
|Connection to a named instance by specifying both the IP address and the TCP port that is being used, in this case 2828.|192.168.17.28,2828|  
|Connecting to default instance by name, forcing a TCP connection.|tcp:APPHOST|  
|Connecting to named instance by name, forcing a TCP connection.|tcp:APPHOST\SQLEXPRESS|  
|Connecting to a default instance by specifying a named pipe name.|\\\APPHOST\pipe\unit\app|  
|Connecting to a named instance by specifying a named pipe name.|\\\APPHOST\pipe\MSSQL$SQLEXPRESS\SQL\query|  
|Connecting to default instance by name, forcing a named pipes connection.|np:APPHOST|  
|Connecting to named instance by name, forcing a named pipes connection.|np:APPHOST\SQLEXPRESS|  
  
## Verifying your Connection Protocol  
 When connected to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)], the following query will return the protocol  used for the current connection, along with the authentication method (NTLM or Kerberos), and will indicate if the connection is encrypted.  
  
```tsql  
SELECT net_transport, auth_scheme, encrypt_option   
FROM sys.dm_exec_connections   
WHERE session_id = @@SPID;  
```
