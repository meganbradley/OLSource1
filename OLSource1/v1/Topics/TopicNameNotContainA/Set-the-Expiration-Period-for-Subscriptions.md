# Set the Expiration Period for Subscriptions
This topic describes how to set the expiration period for subscriptions in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/tsql_md.md)]. The expiration period for subscriptions determines the period of time before a subscription expires and is removed. For more information, see [Subscription Expiration and Deactivation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Subscription-Expiration-and-Deactivation.md).

###  <a name="Recommendations"></a> Recommendations  
  
-   The subscription expiration period is also referred to as the *publication retention period*. Cleanup of merge replication metadata is dependent on this setting:  
  
    -   Replication cannot clean up metadata in the publication and subscription databases until the retention period is reached. Use caution in specifying a high value for the retention period, because it can negatively impact replication performance. It is recommended that you use a lower setting if you can reliably predict that all Subscribers will synchronize regularly within that time period.  
  
         The retention period for merge publications has a 24-hour grace period to accommodate Subscribers in different time zones. If, for example, you set a retention period of one day, the actual retention period is 48 hours.  
  
    -   It is possible to specify that subscriptions never expire, but it is strongly recommended that you do not use this value, because metadata cannot be cleaned up.  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio  
 Set the expiration period for subscriptions on the **General** page of the **Publication Properties - <Publication\>** dialog box. For more information about accessing this dialog box, see [View and Modify Publication Properties](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/View-and-Modify-Publication-Properties.md).  
  
#### To set the expiration period for subscriptions  
  
1.  In the **Subscription expiration** section on the **General** page of the **Publication Properties - <Publication\>** dialog box, specify whether subscriptions should expire.  
  
2.  If they should expire, specify an expiration time period.  
  
##  <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a> Using Transact-SQL  
 You can use replication stored procedures to either set this value when a publication is created or modify this value at a later time.  
  
#### To set the expiration period for a subscription to a snapshot or transactional publication  
  
1.  At the Publisher, execute [sp_addpublication](assetId:///c7167ed1-2b7e-4824-b82b-65f4667c4407). Specify the desired subscription expiration period, in hours, for **@retention**. The default expiration period is 336 hours. For more information, see [Create a Publication](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Create-a-Publication.md).  
  
#### To set the expiration period for a subscription to a merge publication  
  
1.  At the Publisher, execute [sp_addmergepublication](assetId:///28a629a1-7374-4614-9b04-279d290a942a). Specify the desired value for the subscription expiration period for **@retention**. Specify the units in which the expiration period is expressed for **@retention_period_unit**, which can be one of the following:  
  
    -   **1** = week  
  
    -   **2** = month  
  
    -   **3** = year  
  
     The default expiration period is 14 days. For more information, see [Create a Publication](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Create-a-Publication.md).  
  
#### To change the expiration period for a subscription to a snapshot or transactional publication  
  
1.  At the Publisher, execute [sp_changepublication](assetId:///c36e5865-25d5-42b7-b045-dc5036225081). Specify **retention** for **@property** and the new subscription expiration period, in hours, for **@value**.  
  
#### To change the expiration period for a subscription to a merge publication  
  
1.  At the Publisher, execute [sp_helpmergepublication](assetId:///dfe1e1e1-9a65-406a-aced-6385a078e135), specifying **@publication** and **@publisher**. Note the value of **retention_period_unit** in the result set, which can be one of the following:  
  
    -   **0** = day  
  
    -   **1** = week  
  
    -   **2** = month  
  
    -   **3** = year  
  
2.  At the Publisher, execute [sp_changemergepublication](assetId:///81fe1994-7678-4852-980b-e02fedf1e796). Specify **retention** for **@property** and the new subscription expiration period, as text based on the retention period unit from step 1, for **@value**.  
  
3.  (Optional) At the Publisher, execute [sp_changemergepublication](assetId:///81fe1994-7678-4852-980b-e02fedf1e796). Specify **retention_period_unit** for **@property** and a new unit for the subscription expiration period for **@value**.
