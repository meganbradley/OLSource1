# Publish Reports
  From[!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)], you can publish either all the reports and shared data sources in a Report Server project to a report server by deploying the project, or you can publish a single report.Â Before you can publish a report you must specify the URL of the target report server. For more information, see [Set Deployment Properties &#40;Reporting Services&#41;](../Topic/Set%20Deployment%20Properties%20\(Reporting%20Services\).md).  
  
 You can use the [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../../Token\Other/ssKilimanjaro_md.md)] version of [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)] to open, modify, preview, save, and publish both [!INCLUDE[ssRSversion2005](../../Token\Other/ssRSversion2005_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssRSversion10](../../Token\Other/ssRSversion10_md.md)] reports. For more information, see [Deployment and Version Support in SQL Server Data Tools &#40;SSRS&#41;](../Topic/Deployment%20and%20Version%20Support%20in%20SQL%20Server%20Data%20Tools%20\(SSRS\).md).  
  
### To publish all reports in a project  
  
-   On the **Build** menu, click **Deploy \<report project name\>**. Alternatively, in Solution Explorer, right\-click the report project and then click **Deploy**. You can view the status of the publishing process in the Output window.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  When you deploy a Report Server project, the shared data sources in the report project are also deployed.  
  
### To publish a single report  
  
-   In Solution Explorer, right\-click the report and then click **Deploy**. You can view the status of the publishing process in the Output window.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  When you publish a report, you must also deploy the shared data sources that the report uses.
