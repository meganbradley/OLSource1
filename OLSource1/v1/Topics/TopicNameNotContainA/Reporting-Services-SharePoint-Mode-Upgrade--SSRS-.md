# Reporting Services SharePoint Mode Upgrade (SSRS)
  Use the **Reporting Services SharePoint Mode** page to confirm the upgrade of all shared features. [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] SharePoint mode is an [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] shared feature and will be upgraded with all of the other [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] shared features. The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] installation wizard does not support upgrading only one shared feature. All [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] shared features are upgraded at the same time.  
  
## Options  
 The **Next** button is available only if you have selected the **Continue with upgrade** check box. If you do not select the check box, you cannot continue with the upgrade.  
  
 For more information, see [Upgrade and Migrate Reporting Services](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=245628) \(http:\/\/go.microsoft.com\/fwlink\/?LinkID\=245628\).
