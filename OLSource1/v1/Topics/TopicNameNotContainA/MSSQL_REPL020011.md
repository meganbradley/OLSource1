# MSSQL_REPL020011
## Message Details  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Product Name|SQL Server|  
|Event ID|20011|  
|Event Source|MSSQLSERVER|  
|Component|[!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDEnoversion_md.md)]|  
|Symbolic Name||  
|Message Text|The process could not execute '%1' on '%2'.|  
  
## Explanation  
 This error can be raised in a number of circumstances during transactional replication processing, such as when the Log Reader Agent executes **sp_replcmds** (The process could not execute 'sp_replcmds' on <ServerName\>) or **sp_repldone** (The process could not execute 'sp_repldone' on <ServerName\>).  
  
## User Action  
 If this error is raised in a database that you have just restored from a backup, ensure you have followed the steps outlined in the backup and restore documentation, including executing **sp_replrestart** if appropriate. For more information, see [Strategies for Backing Up and Restoring Snapshot and Transactional Replication](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Strategies-for-Backing-Up-and-Restoring-Snapshot-and-Transactional-Replication.md).  
  
 This error is an internal processing error and if it is raised in circumstances other than a restore, it typically indicates that replication must be removed and reconfigured. If you cannot remove replication, contact customer support for assistance.
