# Data Mining Designers and Dialog Boxes
  [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Token\Other/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssASnoversion_md.md)] provides design tools that you can use to create, view, test, and create predictions from data mining models.  
  
 The following table lists the reference topics for the data mining designers and tools in [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssASnoversion_md.md)].  
  
|Topic|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[Data Mining Model Designer &#40;Analysis Services - Data Mining&#41;](../Topic/Data%20Mining%20Model%20Designer%20\(Analysis%20Services%20-%20Data%20Mining\).md)|Use the tools in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)] to define a new mining structure and associated mining models.|  
|[Mining Model Viewers &#40;Data Mining Model Designer&#41;](../Topic/Mining%20Model%20Viewers%20\(Data%20Mining%20Model%20Designer\).md)|Use the custom viewers provided in both [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)] to browse the completed model and better understand the patterns in the data.|  
|[Mining Accuracy Chart Designer &#40;Data Mining&#41;](../Topic/Mining%20Accuracy%20Chart%20Designer%20\(Data%20Mining\).md)|Use the accuracy chart tools, such as lift charts, the classification matrix, and cross\-validation, to assess data mining models and sets of data used for training. All accuracy tools are available in both [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)] .|  
|[Prediction Query Builder &#40;Data Mining&#41;](../Topic/Prediction%20Query%20Builder%20\(Data%20Mining\).md)|Use the Prediction Query Builder provided in both [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)] to|  
|[Mining Structure Properties Dialog &#40;Analysis Services - Data Mining&#41;](../Topic/Mining%20Structure%20Properties%20Dialog%20\(Analysis%20Services%20-%20Data%20Mining\).md)<br /><br /> [Mining Model Properties Dialog Box &#40;Analysis Services - Data Mining&#41;](../Topic/Mining%20Model%20Properties%20Dialog%20Box%20\(Analysis%20Services%20-%20Data%20Mining\).md)|Change the properties of the mining structure or mining model to affect the way that data is handled, to add modeling flags, or edit metadata.|  
|[DMX Query Editor &#40;Analysis Services - Data Mining&#41;](../Topic/DMX%20Query%20Editor%20\(Analysis%20Services%20-%20Data%20Mining\).md)|Use the DMX Query Editor to design and execute statements written in the Data Mining Extensions \(DMX\) language.|
