# System-Versioned Temporal Tables with Memory-Optimized Tables
System-versioned temporal tables for [Memory-Optimized Tables](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Memory-Optimized-Tables.md) are designed to provide cost-effective solution for scenarios where [data audit and point in time analysis](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt631669.aspx) are required on top of data collected with In-Memory OLTP workloads. They provide high transactional throughput, lock-free concurrency and at the same time, ability to store large amount of history data that can be easily queried.  
  
## Overview  
 System-versioned temporal tables automatically keep a full history of data changes and expose convenient Transact-SQL extensions for point in time analysis. In a typical scenario, data history is retained for a very long period of time (multiple months, even years), even though it is not regularly queried.  
  
 Data audit and time-based analysis can be demanded in different environments, especially in OLTP systems that process extremely large numbers of requests and where In-Memory OLTP technology is used. However, using memory-optimized tables in temporal scenarios is challenging because a huge amount of generated historical data commonly exceeds the limit of available RAM memory. At the same time using RAM to store read-only historical data that is accessed less frequently as it becomes older is not an optimal solution.  
  
 System-versioned temporal tables for memory-optimzed tables provide high transactional throughput, lock-free concurrency and at the same time, ability to store large amount of history data by using in-memory tables for storing current data (the temporal table) and disk-based tables for historical data. The impact on DML operations is minimalized through the use of an internal, auto-generated memory-optimized staging table that stores recent history and enables DMLs to be executed from natively compiled code.  
  
 The following diagram illustrates this architecture.![Temporal In&#45;Memory Architecture](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/media/Temporal-In-Memory-Architecture.png "Temporal)  
  
## Implementation Details  
 The following facts about system-versioned temporal tables with memory optimized tables  are considerations of which you need to be aware when creating a system-versioned memory-optimized table. For syntax options and for an example, see [CREATE TABLE (Transact-SQL)](assetId:///1e068443-b9ea-486a-804f-ce7b6e048e8b).  
  
-   Only durable memory-optimized tables can be system-versioned (**DURABILITY = SCHEMA_AND_DATA**).  
  
-   History table for memory-optimized system-versioned table must be disk-based, regardless if it was created by the end user or the system.  
  
-   Querying of current data and DMLs on current table can be used within natively compiled modules. Temporal querying works only in interop mode.  
  
-   When **SYSTEM_VERSIONING = ON**, an internal memory-optimized staging table is automatically created to accept the most recent system-versioned changes that are results of update and delete operations on memory-optimized current table.  
  
-   Data from the internal memory-optimized staging table is regularly moved to the disk-based history table by the asynchronous data flush task. This data flush mechanism has a goal to keep the internal memory buffers at less than 10% of the memory consumption of their parent objects. You can track the total memory consumption of memory-optimized system-versioned temporal table by querying [sys.dm_db_xtp_memory_consumers (Transact-SQL)](assetId:///f7ab2eaf-e627-464d-91fe-0e170b3f37bc) and summarizing the data for the internal memory-optimized staging table and the current temporal table.  
  
-   You can enforce a data flush by invoking [sys.sp_xtp_flush_temporal_history](assetId:///322e3170-93f8-468a-a123-104ce7bd7fad).  
  
-   When **SYSTEM_VERSIONING = OFF** or when schema of system-versioned table is modified by adding, dropping or altering columns, the entire contents of the internal staging buffer is moved into the disk-based history table.  
  
-   Querying of historical data is effectively under SNAPSHOT isolation level and always returns a union between in-memory staging buffer and disk based table without duplicates. In CTP3 of [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL15_md.md)], the disk-based history table cannot be directly queried. Query the historical table using the [CONTAINED IN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms177634.aspx) syntax.  
  
-   **ALTER TABLE** operations that change the table schema internally must perform a data flush, which may prolong the duration of the operation.  
  
## The Internal Memory-Optimized Staging Table  
 The internal memory-optimized staging table is an internal object that is created by the system to optimize DML operations.  
  
-   The table name is generated in the following format: **Memory_Optimized_History_Table_<object_id>** where *<object_id>* is identifier of the current temporal table.  
  
-   The table replicates the schema of current temporal table plus one BIGINT column. This additional column guarantees the uniqueness of the rows moved to internal history buffer.  
  
-   The additional column has the following name format: **Change_ID[_< suffix>]**, where *_<suffix\>* is optionally added in the case where the table already has a *Change_ID* column.  
  
-   The maximum row size for a system-versioned memory-optimized table is reduced by 8 bytes because of the additional BIGINT column in staging table. The new maximum is now 8052 bytes.  
  
-   The internal memory-optimized staging table is not represented in Object Explorer of SQL Server Management Studio.  
  
-   Metadata about this table as well as its connection with current temporal table can be found in [sys.internal_tables (Transact-SQL)](assetId:///a5821c70-f150-4676-8476-3a31f7403dca).  
  
## The Data Flush Task  
 The data flush is a regularly activated task that checks whether any memory-optimized table meets a memory size-based condition for data movement. Data movement starts when memory consumption of internal staging table reaches 8% of memory consumption of current temporal table.  
  
 The data flush task is activated regularly with a schedule that varies based on the existing workload. With a heavy workload, as frequent as every 5 seconds, and with a light workload, as infrequent as every 1 minute. One thread is spawned for each internal memory-optimized staging table that needs cleanup.  
  
 Data flush deletes all records from in-memory internal buffer that are older than the oldest currently running transaction to move these records to the disk-based history table.  
  
 You can enforce a data flush by invoking [sys.sp_xtp_flush_temporal_history](assetId:///322e3170-93f8-468a-a123-104ce7bd7fad) and specifying the schema and table name:   
**sys.sp_xtp_flush_temporal_history  @schema_name, @object_name**. With this user-executed command, the same data movement process is invoked as when data flush task is invoked by the system on internal schedule.
