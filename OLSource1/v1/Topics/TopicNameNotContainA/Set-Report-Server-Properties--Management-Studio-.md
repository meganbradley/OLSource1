# Set Report Server Properties (Management Studio)
  You can set report server system properties in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../Token\Other/ssManStudio_md.md)] to enable features or set server defaults.  
  
### To open the Advanced Server Properties page  
  
1.  Start [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../Token\Other/ssManStudio_md.md)] and connect to a report server instance.  
  
2.  Right\-click the report server node, and select **Properties**. Click **Advanced** to open the properties page. See [Server Properties &#40;Advanced Page&#41; - Reporting Services](../Topic/Server%20Properties%20\(Advanced%20Page\)%20-%20Reporting%20Services.md) for a description of each property.
