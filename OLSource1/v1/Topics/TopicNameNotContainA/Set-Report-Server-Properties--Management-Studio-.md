# Set Report Server Properties (Management Studio)
You can set report server system properties in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudio_md.md)] to enable features or set server defaults.  
  
### To open the Advanced Server Properties page  
  
1.  Start [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudio_md.md)] and connect to a report server instance.  
  
2.  Right-click the report server node, and select **Properties**. Click **Advanced** to open the properties page. See [Server Properties (Advanced Page) - Reporting Services](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Server-Properties--Advanced-Page----Reporting-Services.md) for a description of each property.
