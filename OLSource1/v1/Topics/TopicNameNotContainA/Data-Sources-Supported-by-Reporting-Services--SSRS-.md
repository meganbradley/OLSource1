# Data Sources Supported by Reporting Services (SSRS)
  [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] retrieves report data from data sources through a modular and extensible data layer that uses data processing extensions. To retrieve report data from a data source, you must select a data processing extension that supports the type of data source, the version of software running on the data source, and the data source platform (32-bit or 64-bit [!INCLUDE[vcprx64](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/vcprx64_md.md)]).  
  
 When you deploy [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)], a set of data processing extensions are automatically installed and registered on both the report authoring client and on the report server to provide access to a variety of data source types. [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] installs the following data source types:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)]  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] for MDX, DMX, [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssGemini_md.md)], and tabular models  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssSDSFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSDSfull_md.md)]  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Parallel Data Warehouse  
  
-   Oracle  
  
-   SAP NetWeaver BI  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[extEssbase](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/extEssbase_md.md)]  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] SharePoint List  
  
-   Teradata  
  
-   OLE DB  
  
-   ODBC  
  
-   XML  
  
 In addition, custom data processing extensions and standard [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] data providers can be installed and registered by system administrators. To process and view a report, the data processing extensions and data providers must be installed and registered on the report server; to preview a report, they must be installed and registered on the report authoring client. Data processing extensions and data providers must be natively compiled for the platform where they are installed. If you deploy a data source programmatically by using the SOAP Web service, you must define the data source extension. Use data extension values from the **RSReportDesigner.config** file. By default, the file is located in the following folder:  
  
```  
<drive letter>\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE\PrivateAssemblies  
```  
  
 For example, the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] data extension is OLEDB-MD.  
  
 Many third-party standard [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] data providers are available as downloads from the [Microsoft Download Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=51456) and from third-party sites. You can also search the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] public forum for information about third-party data providers.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Standard [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] data providers do not necessarily support all the functionality supplied by [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] data processing extensions. In addition, some OLE DB data providers and ODBC drivers can be used to author and preview reports, but are not designed to support reports published on a report server. For example, the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] OLE DB Provider for Jet is not supported on the report server. For more information, see [Data Processing Extensions and .NET Framework Data Providers &#40;SSRS&#41;](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Data-Processing-Extensions-and-.NET-Framework-Data-Providers--SSRS-.md).  
  
 For more information about custom data processing extensions, see [Implementing a Data Processing Extension](../Topic/Implementing%20a%20Data%20Processing%20Extension.md). For more information about standard [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] data providers, see the [System.Data](assetId:///N:System.Data) namespace.  
  
 For more information about data processing extensions supported by Report Builder, see [Data Connections, Data Sources, and Connection Strings in Report Builder](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Data-Connections--Data-Sources--and-Connection-Strings-in-Report-Builder.md) in the [Report Builder documentation](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=154494) on msdn.microsoft.com.  
  
## Platform Support for Report Data Sources  
 The data sources you can use in a [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] deployment vary by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] edition, [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] version, and by platform. For more information about features, see [Features Supported by the Editions of SQL Server 2016](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Features-Supported-by-the-Editions-of-SQL-Server-2016.md). The table later in this topic provides information about supported data sources by version and by platform.  
  
 Platform considerations for [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] data sources are separate for the report authoring client and the report server.  
  
### On the report authoring client  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ss_dtbi](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ss_dtbi_md.md)] is a 32-bit application. [!INCLUDE[ss_dtbi](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ss_dtbi_md.md)] is not supported on an Itanium-based platform. On an x64 platform, to edit and preview reports in Report Designer, you must have 32-bit data providers installed in the (x86) platform directory.  
  
### On the report server  
 When you deploy a report to a 64-bit report server (x86), the report server must have natively compiled 64-bit data providers installed. Wrapping a 32-bit data provider in 64-bit interfaces is not supported. For more information, check the documentation for the data provider.  
  
## Supported Data Sources  
 The following table lists [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] data processing extensions and data providers that you can use to retrieve data for report datasets and report models. For more information about an extension or data provider, click the link in the second column. The table columns are described as follows:  
  
-   Source of report data: The type of data being accessed; for example, relational database, multidimensional database, flat file, or XML. This column answers the question: "What types of data can [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] use for a report?"  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] Data Source Type: One of the data source types you see in the drop-down list when you define a data source in [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)]. This list is populated from installed and registered DPEs and data providers. This column answers the question: "What data source type do I select from the drop-down list when I create a report data source?"  
  
-   Name of Data Processing Extension/Data Provider: The [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] data processing extension or other data provider that corresponds to the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] data source type selected. This column answers the question: "When I select a data source type, which corresponding data processing extension or data provider is used?"  
  
-   Underlying Data Provider version (Optional): Some data source types support more than one data provider. These could be different versions of the same provider or different implementations by third-parties for a type of data provider. The provider name frequently appears in the connection string after you have configured a data source. This column answers the question: "After selecting the data source type, what data provider do I select in the **Connection Properties** dialog box?"  
  
-   Data Source *<platform\>*: The data source platform supported by the data processing extension or data provider for the target data source. This column answers the question: "Can this data processing extension or data provider retrieve data from a data source on this type of platform?"  
  
-   Version of data source: The version of the target data source supported by the DPE or data provider. This column answers the question: "Can this data processing extension or data provider retrieve data from this version of the data source?"  
  
-   RS *<platform\>*: The platforms for the report server and report authoring client where you can install a custom DPE or data provider. The built-in [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] data processing extensions are included with any installation of [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)]. A custom data processing extension or [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] data provider must be compiled natively for a specific platform. This column answers the question: "Can this data processing extension or data provider be installed on this type of platform?"

## Reporting Services Data Processing Extensions  
 The following data processing extensions are automatically installed with [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ss_dtbi](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ss_dtbi_md.md)]. For more information and to verify the installation, see [RSReportDesigner Configuration File](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/RSReportDesigner-Configuration-File.md) and [RsReportServer.config Configuration File](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/RsReportServer.config-Configuration-File.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] data processing extension is not supported at this time.  
  
 For more information about data processing extensions supported by Report Builder, see [Data Connections, Data Sources, and Connection Strings in Report Builder](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Data-Connections--Data-Sources--and-Connection-Strings-in-Report-Builder.md) in the [Report Builder documentation](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=154494) on msdn.microsoft.com.  
  
###  <a name="MicrosoftSQLServer"></a> Microsoft SQL Server Data Processing Extension  
 The data source type **Microsoft SQL Server** wraps and extends the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] Data Provider for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)]. This data processing extension is natively compiled for and runs on x86 and [!INCLUDE[vcprx64](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/vcprx64_md.md)]-based platforms.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[ss_dtbi](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ss_dtbi_md.md)], the query designer associated with this data extension is the [Visual Database Tool Designer](../Topic/Visual%20Database%20Tool%20Designers.md). If you use the query designer in graphical mode, the query is analyzed and possibly rewritten. Use the text-based query designer when you want to control the exact [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/tsql_md.md)] syntax that is used for a query. For more information, see [Query and View Designer Tools &#40;Visual Database Tools&#41;](../Topic/Query%20and%20View%20Designer%20Tools%20\(Visual%20Database%20Tools\).md) and [Graphical Query Designer User Interface](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Graphical-Query-Designer-User-Interface.md).  
  
 For more information, see [SQL Server Connection Type &#40;SSRS&#41;](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/SQL-Server-Connection-Type--SSRS-.md).  
  
 In Report Builder, the query designer associated with this data extension is the Relational Query Designer. For more information, see [Relational Query Designer User Interface](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Relational-Query-Designer-User-Interface.md).

###  <a name="Azure"></a> Windows Azure SQL Database Processing Extension  
 The data source type **[!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSDS_md.md)]** wraps and extends the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] Data Provider for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)].  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[ss_dtbi](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ss_dtbi_md.md)], the graphical query designer associated with this data extension is the [Relational Query Designer User Interface](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Relational-Query-Designer-User-Interface.md), not the [Visual Database Tool Designer](../Topic/Visual%20Database%20Tool%20Designers.md) that you use with the **Microsoft SQL Server** data source type.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ss_dtbi](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ss_dtbi_md.md)] automatically differentiates between **[!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSDS_md.md)]** and **Microsoft SQL Server** data source types and opens the graphical query designer associated with the data source type.  
  
 If you use the query designer in graphical mode, the query is analyzed and possibly rewritten. A text-based query designer is also available for writing queries. Use the text-based query designer when you want to control the exact [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/tsql_md.md)] syntax that is used for a query. For more information, see [Text-based Query Designer User Interface](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Text-based-Query-Designer-User-Interface.md).  
  
 Retrieving data from [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSDS_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] is similar, but there are a few requirements that apply only to [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSDS_md.md)]. For more information, see [SQL Azure Connection Type &#40;SSRS&#41;](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/SQL-Azure-Connection-Type--SSRS-.md).

###  <a name="PWD"></a> Microsoft SQL Server Parallel Data Warehouse Processing Extension  
 In [!INCLUDE[ss_dtbi](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ss_dtbi_md.md)], the graphical query designer associated with this data extension is the [Relational Query Designer User Interface](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Relational-Query-Designer-User-Interface.md), not the [Visual Database Tool Designer](../Topic/Visual%20Database%20Tool%20Designers.md) that you use with the **Microsoft SQL Server** data source type.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ss_dtbi](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ss_dtbi_md.md)] automatically differentiates between **SQL Server Parallel Data Warehouse** and **Microsoft SQL Server** data source types and opens the graphical query designer associated with the data source type.  
  
 If you use the query designer in graphical mode, the query is analyzed and possibly rewritten. A text-based query designer is also available for writing queries. Use the text-based query designer when you want to control the exact [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/tsql_md.md)] syntax that is used for a query. For more information, see [Text-based Query Designer User Interface](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Text-based-Query-Designer-User-Interface.md).  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssDWCurrentFull](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ssDWCurrentFull_md.md)] does not support the use of stored procedures and table-valued functions in queries. For more information, see [SQL Server Parallel Data Warehouse Connection Type &#40;SSRS&#41;](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/SQL-Server-Parallel-Data-Warehouse-Connection-Type--SSRS-.md).

###  <a name="SharePointList"></a> SharePoint List Data Extension  
 [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] includes the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] SharePoint List Data Extension so that you can use SharePoint lists as a source of data in a report. You can retrieve list data from the following:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[SPS2013](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/SPS2013_md.md)]  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[SPF2010](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/SPF2010_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[SPS2010](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/SPS2010_md.md)]  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[winSPServ](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/winSPServ_md.md)] 3.0 and [!INCLUDE[offSPServ](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/offSPServ_md.md)] 2007  
  
 There are three implementations of the SharePoint List data provider.  
  
1.  From a report authoring environment such as Report Builder or Report Designer in [!INCLUDE[ss_dtbi](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ss_dtbi_md.md)], or for a report server that is configured in native mode, list data comes from the Lists.asmx Web service for the SharePoint site.  
  
2.  On a report server that is configured in SharePoint integrated mode, list data comes from either the corresponding Lists.asmx Web service or from programmatic calls to the SharePoint API. In this mode, you can retrieve list data from a SharePoint farm.  
  
3.  For [!INCLUDE[SPS2010](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/SPS2010_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[SPS2013](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/SPS2013_md.md)], the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] Add-in for [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] SharePoint Technologies enables you to retrieve list data from a Lists.asmx Web service for a SharePoint site, or from SharePoint site that is part of a SharePoint farm. This scenario is also known as *local mode* because a report server is not required.  
  
 The credentials that you can specify depend on the implementation that the client application uses. For more information, see [SharePoint List Connection Type &#40;SSRS&#41;](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/SharePoint-List-Connection-Type--SSRS-.md).
