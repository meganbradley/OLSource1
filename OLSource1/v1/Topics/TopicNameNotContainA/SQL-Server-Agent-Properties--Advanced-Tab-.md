# SQL Server Agent Properties (Advanced Tab)
  Five properties appear on the **Advanced** tab by default. If custom properties are defined, they also appear on this tab, with their values.  
  
## Options  
 **Clustered**  
 Indicates if this service is installed as a resource of a clustered server.  
  
 **Customer Feedback Reporting**  
 Indicates whether Service Quality Monitoring has been enabled on this service. For more information on Customer Feedback Reporting, search Books Online for the topic, "Error and Usage Report Settings."  
  
 **Dump Directory**  
 Displays the location where memory dumps are placed in case of an error.  
  
 **Error Reporting**  
 When set to **Yes**, the Dr. Watson program forwards information to either [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Token\Other/msCoName_md.md)] or your error server if a serious failure occurs. For more information on Error Reporting, search Books Online for the topic, "Error and Usage Report Settings."  
  
 **Instance ID**
