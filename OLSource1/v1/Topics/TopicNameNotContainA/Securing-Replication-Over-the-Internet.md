# Securing Replication Over the Internet
Replication over the Internet can provide flexibility, particularly for mobile Subscribers, but you must configure Internet replication appropriately to ensure adequate security. [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] recommends using one of two techniques for securely sharing information over the Internet:  
  
-   Virtual private network (VPN)  
  
-   The Web synchronization option for merge replication  
  
## Virtual Private Network  
 Virtual private networks provide a simple and secure layered approach to replicating [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] data over the Internet. The VPN connection over the Internet logically operates as a Wide Area Network (WAN) link between the sites.  
  
 This is achieved by allowing the user to tunnel through the Internet or another public network using a protocol such as [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) available with the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] Windows NT version 4.0 or [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] Windows 2000 operating system, or Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) available with the Windows 2000 operating system. This process provides security and features similar to those available in a private network.  
  
 For more information about setting up a VPN, see the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] Windows documentation.  
  
## Web Synchronization Through IIS  
 The web synchronization option for merge replication provides the ability to replicate data using the HTTPS protocol, which can be a convenient approach to replicating data through a firewall. For more information, see [Configure Web Synchronization](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Configure-Web-Synchronization.md) and [Security Architecture for Web Synchronization](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Security-Architecture-for-Web-Synchronization.md).
