# Publication Properties, Subscription Options
The **Subscription Options** page of the **Publication Properties** dialog box allows you to view and set publication level properties associated with subscriptions. The properties are grouped into the following categories:  
  
-   Properties that apply to all publications.  
  
-   Properties that apply to snapshot and transactional publications (including those that allow updating subscriptions).  
  
-   Properties that apply to merge publications.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Some properties are read-only; the reasons are covered in the property descriptions in this topic. Some property changes require a new snapshot for the publication, and some also require that all subscriptions be reinitialized. For more information, see [Change Publication and Article Properties](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Change-Publication-and-Article-Properties.md).  
  
## Options for all publications  
  
### Creation and Synchronization  
 **Allow anonymous subscriptions**  
 Determines whether to allow anonymous pull subscriptions. Anonymous subscriptions are supported for [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssEWEd2005](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ssEWEd2005_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssMobileEd2005](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ssMobileEd2005_md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] for Windows CE. To use this option for snapshot and transactional publications, the option **Snapshot always available** must be set to **True**.  
  
 **Attachable subscription database**  
 Determines whether subscriptions can be created by attaching a copy of a subscription database (requires that the option **Snapshot always available** is set to **True** for snapshot and transactional publications).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Attachable subscriptions will not be available in a future release. The feature is deprecated.  
  
 **Allow pull subscriptions**  
 Determines whether to allow Subscribers to create pull subscriptions to this publication. For more information, see [Subscribe to Publications](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Subscribe-to-Publications.md).  
  
### Schema Replication  
 **Replicate schema changes**  
 [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssVersion2005_md.md)] and later versions only. Determines whether to replicate schema changes (such as adding a column to a table or changing the data type of a column) to published objects. For more information, see [Make Schema Changes on Publication Databases](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Make-Schema-Changes-on-Publication-Databases.md).  
  
## Options for snapshot and transactional publications  
  
### Creation and Synchronization  
 **Independent Distribution Agent**  
 Determines whether to use an agent that is independent of other publications from this database. This option is read-only; it is set to **True** by default for publications created with the New Publication Wizard and cannot be changed after the publication is created. For more information, see [Replication Agent Administration](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Replication-Agent-Administration.md).  
  
 **Snapshot always available**  
 Determines whether snapshot files are created every time the Snapshot Agent runs (requires **Independent Distribution Agent**). This option is read-only; it is set to **True** if you select **Create a snapshot immediately and keep the snapshot available to initialize subscriptions** on the **Snapshot Agent** page of the New Publication Wizard (the default). For more information, see [Create and Apply the Snapshot](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Create-and-Apply-the-Snapshot.md).  
  
 **Allow initialization from backup files**  
 [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssVersion2005_md.md)] and later versions only. Determines whether to allow backup files to be used to initialize subscriptions. For more information, see [Initialize a Transactional Subscription Without a Snapshot](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Initialize-a-Transactional-Subscription-Without-a-Snapshot.md).  
  
 **Allow non-SQL Server Subscribers**  
 [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssVersion2005_md.md)] and later versions only. Determines whether the publication supports non-[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Subscribers. Setting this option to **True** sets other publication properties to support non-[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Subscribers. This option is read-only if subscriptions exist; it cannot be set to **True** if **Allow immediate updating subscriptions**, **Allow queued updating subscriptions**, or **Allow peer-to-peer subscriptions** is set to **True**. For more information, see [Non-SQL Server Subscribers](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Non-SQL-Server-Subscribers.md).  
  
### Data Transformation  
 **Allow data transformations**  
 Determines whether to use Data Transformation Services (DTS) to transform data before distributing it to a Subscriber. This option is read-only; data transformations can be enabled only if a publication is created using stored procedures.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Transformable subscriptions will not be available in a future release. The feature is deprecated.  
  
### Peer-to-Peer Replication  
 **Allow peer-to-peer subscriptions**  
 Applies to only [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssVersion2005_md.md)] and later versions. Determines whether the publication supports peer-to-peer replication. Setting this option to **True** sets other publication properties to support peer-to-peer replication. This option is read-only if subscriptions exist. This option cannot be set to **True** if **Allow immediate updating subscriptions** or **Allow queued updating subscriptions**, or **Allow non-SQL Server Subscribers** is set to **True**. For more information, see [Peer-to-Peer Transactional Replication](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Peer-to-Peer-Transactional-Replication.md).  
  
 **Allow peer-to-peer conflict detection**  
 Applies to only [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssKatmai_md.md)] and later versions. Specifies whether conflict detection is enabled for this publication. To use conflict detection, all nodes must be running [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssKatmai_md.md)] or a later version; and detection must be enabled for all nodes. To use conflict detection, you must also specify a value for **Peer originator id**. For more information, see [Conflict Detection in Peer-to-Peer Replication](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Conflict-Detection-in-Peer-to-Peer-Replication.md).  
  
 **Peer originator id**  
 Applies to only [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssKatmai_md.md)] and later versions. Specifies an ID for a node in a peer-to-peer topology. This ID is used for conflict detection if **Allow peer-to-peer conflict detection** is set to **True**. Specify a positive, nonzero ID that has never been used in the topology. For a list of IDs that have already been used, query the [Mspeer_originatorid_history](assetId:///c1f53d0f-4080-43ff-be38-2b10395c68c9) system table.  
  
### Updatable Subscriptions  
 **Allow immediate updating subscriptions**  
 Determines whether Subscriber data changes can be immediately replicated to the Publisher. This option is read-only; updating subscriptions can be enabled only when a publication is created. For more information, see [Updatable Subscriptions for Transactional Replication](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Updatable-Subscriptions-for-Transactional-Replication.md).  
  
 **Allow queued updating subscriptions**  
 Determines whether Subscriber data changes can be queued and replicated to the Publisher at a later time. This option is read-only; updating subscriptions can be enabled only when a publication is created. For more information, see [Updatable Subscriptions for Transactional Replication](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Updatable-Subscriptions-for-Transactional-Replication.md).  
  
 **Report conflicts centrally**  
 Determines whether to report conflicting data changes only at the Publisher or at both the Publisher and the Subscriber (requires the option **Allow queued updating subscriptions**). This option is read-only; it is set to **True** by default for publications created with the New Publication Wizard and cannot be changed after the publication is created. A value of **True** means conflicts are reported only at the Publisher. Conflicts can be viewed only where they are reported.  
  
 **Conflict resolution policy**  
 Specifies the action to take when a Subscriber change conflicts with a Publisher change (requires the option **Allow queued updating subscriptions**). For more information, see [Queued Updating Conflict Detection and Resolution](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Queued-Updating-Conflict-Detection-and-Resolution.md).  
  
 **Queue type**  
 Determines whether to use a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] queue or [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] Message Queuing (MSMQ) to queue changes at the Subscriber until they can be applied to the Publisher (requires the option **Allow queued updating subscriptions**). This option is relevant only for [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2000](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssVersion2000_md.md)]; later versions always use [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] tables for queuing.  
  
## Options for merge publications  
  
### Conflict Reporting  
 **Report conflicts centrally**  
 Determines whether to report conflicting data changes only at the Publisher or at both the Publisher and the Subscriber. This option is read-only; it is set to **True** by default for publications created with the New Publication Wizard and cannot be changed after the publication is created. A value of **True** means conflicts are reported only at the Publisher. Conflicts can be viewed only where they are reported. For more information, see the "Viewing Conflicts" section of [Advanced Merge Replication Conflict Detection and Resolution](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Advanced-Merge-Replication-Conflict-Detection-and-Resolution.md).  
  
### Filtering  
 **Allow parameterized filters**  
 Set based on whether a publication uses parameterized filters. This option is always read-only. For more information, see [Parameterized Row Filters](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Parameterized-Row-Filters.md).  
  
 **Validate Subscribers**  
 Determines which functions to use when validating that a Subscriber has the correct partition of data. Separate multiple values by commas. For more information, see [Validate Partition Information for a Merge Subscriber](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Validate-Partition-Information-for-a-Merge-Subscriber.md).  
  
 **Precompute partitions**  
 [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssVersion2005_md.md)] and later versions only. Determines whether to optimize synchronization by computing in advance which data rows belong in which partitions. This setting defaults to **True** if the publication meets the criteria for precomputed partitions. For more information, see [Optimize Parameterized Filter Performance with Precomputed Partitions](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Optimize-Parameterized-Filter-Performance-with-Precomputed-Partitions.md).  
  
 **Optimize synchronization**  
 Determines whether to optimize merge processing by storing additional metadata at each Subscriber. This optimization has been superseded by precomputed partitions; the **Optimize synchronization** option is only relevant if **Precompute partitions** is set to **False**. For more information, see [Parameterized Row Filters](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Parameterized-Row-Filters.md).  
  
### Merge Processes  
 **Limit concurrent processes**  
 Determines whether to limit the number of Merge Agents that can run at the same time. This is typically used if a publication has lots of push subscriptions that might be synchronizing at the same time.  
  
 **Maximum concurrent processes**  
 The maximum number of Merge Agents that can run at the same time (requires **Limit concurrent processes**). If the number of agents synchronizing exceeds the maximum, agents are put in a queue until the number drops under the maximum.
