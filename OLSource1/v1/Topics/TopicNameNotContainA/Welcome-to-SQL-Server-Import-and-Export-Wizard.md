# Welcome to SQL Server Import and Export Wizard
  When you run the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Import and Export Wizard, the first page is **Welcome to SQL Server Import and Export Wizard**. You don't have to take any action on this page.  
  
 This page describes the first page of the Wizard. If you're looking for info about the Wizard and how it works, including a list of the steps in the wizard, see [SQL Server Import and Export Wizard](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/SQL-Server-Import-and-Export-Wizard.md).
  
## Get the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard  
 If you don't have [!INCLUDE[msCoName] (../Token/msCoName_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] installed on your computer, you can install the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Import and Export Wizard  by installing SQL Server Data Tools \(SSDT\). For more info, see [Download SQL Server Data Tools \(SSDT\)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt204009.aspx).  
  
 You may also have to install additional files to connect to certain data sources and destinations. For more info, see [Data sources that you can use](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/SQL-Server-Import-and-Export-Wizard.md).
