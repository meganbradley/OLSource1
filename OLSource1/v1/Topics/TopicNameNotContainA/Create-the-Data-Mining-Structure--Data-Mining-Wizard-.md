# Create the Data Mining Structure (Data Mining Wizard)
  Use the **Create the Data Mining Structure** page to create a data mining structure and optionally create an associated mining model.  
  
 If you choose to create a mining model, you must also specify the data mining algorithm that you want to use. If you create only the structure now, you can add a mining model to the structure later.  
  
 **For More Information:** [Data Mining Algorithms &#40;Analysis Services - Data Mining&#41;](../Topic/Data%20Mining%20Algorithms%20\(Analysis%20Services%20-%20Data%20Mining\).md), [Data Mining Wizard &#40;Analysis Services - Data Mining&#41;](../Topic/Data%20Mining%20Wizard%20\(Analysis%20Services%20-%20Data%20Mining\).md), [Create a Relational Mining Structure](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/Create-a-Relational-Mining-Structure.md)  
  
## Options  
 **Create mining structure with a mining model**  
 Select to create a mining structure and then create an associated model.  
  
 **Which data mining technique do you want to use?**  
 Select the data mining algorithm to use with this model.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The list of algorithms is populated from the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssASnoversion_md.md)] on which you are creating the mining structure. If the server is not available, only the default algorithms will be available.  
  
 **Create mining structure with no models**  
 Select to create only a mining structure.  
  
 **Description**  
 Displays a description of the selected algorithm.
