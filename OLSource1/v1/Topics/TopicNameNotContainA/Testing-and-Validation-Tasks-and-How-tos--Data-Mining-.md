# Testing and Validation Tasks and How-tos (Data Mining)
  You can use the **Mining Accuracy Chart** tab of Data Mining Designer in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)] to compare the predictive accuracy of the mining models in your mining structure.  
  
 You can create four kinds of charts:  
  
-   Lift chart  
  
-   Profit chart  
  
-   Classification matrix  
  
-   Cross\-validation report  
  
 The first three charts use the **Input Selection** tab to define the data that is used for generating the chart.  
  
 The Cross\-validation chart is created by using additional inputs, available on the **Cross\-Validation** tab. For more information, see [Cross-Validation &#40;Analysis Services - Data Mining&#41;](../Topic/Cross-Validation%20\(Analysis%20Services%20-%20Data%20Mining\).md).  
  
 For more information about how to use the mining accuracy chart, see [Testing and Validation &#40;Data Mining&#41;](../Topic/Testing%20and%20Validation%20\(Data%20Mining\).md).
