# Testing and Validation Tasks and How-tos (Data Mining)
You can use the **Mining Accuracy Chart** tab of Data Mining Designer in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)] to compare the predictive accuracy of the mining models in your mining structure.  
  
 You can create four kinds of charts:  
  
-   Lift chart  
  
-   Profit chart  
  
-   Classification matrix  
  
-   Cross-validation report  
  
 The first three charts use the **Input Selection** tab to define the data that is used for generating the chart.  
  
 The Cross-validation chart is created by using additional inputs, available on the **Cross-Validation** tab. For more information, see [Cross-Validation (Analysis Services - Data Mining)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Cross-Validation--Analysis-Services---Data-Mining-.md).  
  
 For more information about how to use the mining accuracy chart, see [Testing and Validation (Data Mining)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Testing-and-Validation--Data-Mining-.md).
