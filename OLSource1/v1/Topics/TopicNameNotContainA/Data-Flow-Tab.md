# Data Flow Tab
Use the **Data Flow** tab of [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssIS_md.md)] Designer to create data flows in a [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] package.  
  
 Create the data flows by dragging graphical objects that represent sources, transformations, and destinations from the **Toolbox** to the design surface of the **Data Flow** tab, and then connecting the objects to create paths that determine the sequence in which the transformations run.  
  
 Right-click a path, and then click **Data Viewers,** to add data viewers to view the data before and after each data flow object.  
  
 You can also use [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssIS_md.md)] Designer to add the following functionality from the **Data Flow** tab:  
  
-   Manage variables  
  
-   Add annotations  
  
 To add these functions in [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssIS_md.md)] Designer, right-click the design surface, and then select the option you want.
