# Reporting Services Login Dialog Box (SSRS)
Use the **Reporting Services Login** dialog box to provide credentials to publish reports to the report server.  
  
-   **Note** If this is the first time you have published a report to a report server since set you set the deployment property **TargetServerURL** for a project, verify that the server name includes **server** and not **reports**. For example, `http://localhost/reportserver`, and not `http://localhost/reports`. Specifying the `reports` directory on the local server instead of the `reportserver` directory indirectly causes this dialog box to open. For more information about setting **TargetServerURL**, see [Set Deployment Properties (Reporting Services)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Set-Deployment-Properties--Reporting-Services-.md).  
  
## Options  
 **Server**  
 Displays the name of the report server. For example, `http://localhost/reportserver`. For report servers that use a different port than default port 80, include the port number. For example, `http://localhost:81/reportserver`.  
  
 **User name**  
 Type the user name to log in to the Web service.  
  
 **Password**  
 Type the password to log in to the Web service.
