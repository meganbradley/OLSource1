# Master Data Services
[!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)] (MDS) is the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] solution for master data management. Master data management (MDM) enables you organization to discover and define non-transactional lists of data, and compile maintainable, reliable master lists. This article briefly describe the MDS components and provides links to additional information.  
  
 For information about the new features in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)], see [What's New in Master Data Services (MDS)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/What-s-New-in-Master-Data-Services--MDS-.md).  
  
 **Download**  
  
-   To download [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL15_md.md)], go to  **[Evaluation Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-sql-server-2016)**.

 You can use [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)] to manage any domain; it's not specific to managing lists of customers, products, or accounts. [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)] includes the following components and tools:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssMDScfgmgr](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDScfgmgr_md.md)], a tool you use to create and configure [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)] databases and web applications.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSmdm_md.md)], a web application you use to perform administrative tasks (like creating a model or business rule), and that users access to update data.  
  
-   MDSModelDeploy.exe, a tool you use to create packages of your model objects and data so you can deploy them to other environments.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)] web service, which developers can use to extend or develop custom solutions for [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)].  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssMDSXLS](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSXLS_md.md)], which you use to manage data and create new entities and attributes.
