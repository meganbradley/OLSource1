# Supported Data Sources (SSAS - Multidimensional)
This topic describes the types of data sources that you can use in a multidimensional model.  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_supported_ds"></a> Supported Data Sources  
 You can retrieve data from the data sources in the following table. When you install [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)], setup does not install the providers that are listed for each data source. Some providers might already be installed with other applications on your computer; in other cases you will need to download and install the provider.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Third party providers, such as the Oracle OLE DB Provider, may also be used to connect to third party databases, with support provided by those third parties.

|Source|Versions|File type|Providers*|  
|Access databases|Microsoft Access  2010, 2013, 2016|.accdb or .mdb|Microsoft Jet 4.0 OLE DB provider|  
|SQL Server relational databases*|Microsoft SQL Server 2008, 2008 R2, 2012, 2014, 2016, [!INCLUDE[ssSDSfull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSDSfull_md.md)] , Microsoft Analytics Platform System (APS)<br /><br /> <br /><br /> Note: For more information about [!INCLUDE[ssSDS](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSDS_md.md)] on [Azure.com](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=157856).<br /><br /> Note: Analytics Platform System (APS) was formerly known as SQL Server Parallel Datawarehouse (PDW). Originally, connecting to PDW from Analysis Services required a special data provider. This provider was replaced in SQL Server 2012. Starting in SQL Server 2012, the SQL Server native client is used for connections to PDW/APS. For more information about APS, see the web site [Microsoft Analytics Platform System](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/analytics-platform-system/resources.aspx).|(not applicable)|OLE DB Provider for SQL Server<br /><br /> SQL Server Native Client OLE DB Provider<br /><br /> SQL Server Native 11.0 Client OLE DB Provider<br /><br /> .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Client|  
|Oracle relational databases|Oracle 9i, 10g, 11g, 12g|(not applicable)|Oracle OLE DB Provider<br /><br /> .NET Framework Data Provider for Oracle Client<br /><br /> .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server<br /><br /> OraOLEDB<br /><br /> MSDASQL|  
|Teradata relational databases|Teradata V2R6, V12|(not applicable)|TDOLEDB OLE DB provider<br /><br /> .Net Data Provider for Teradata|  
|Informix relational databases|V11.10|(not applicable)|Informix OLE DB provider|  
|IBM DB2 relational databases|8.1|(not applicable)|DB2OLEDB|  
|Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) relational databases|15.0.2|(not applicable)|Sybase OLE DB provider|  
|Other relational databases|(not applicable)|(not applicable)|OLE DB provider or ODBC driver|  
  
 \* ODBC data sources are not supported for multidimensional solutions. Although Analysis Services itself will handle the connection, the designers in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudio](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudio_md.md)] used for building data source views, dimensions, and cubes cannot connect to an ODBC data source, even when using MSDASQL driver (.NET driver for ODBC). If your business requirements include an ODBC data source, consider building a tabular solution instead.  
  
 **Some features require a SQL Server relational database that runs on-premises. Specifically, writeback and ROLAP storage require that the underlying data source is a SQL Server relational database.
