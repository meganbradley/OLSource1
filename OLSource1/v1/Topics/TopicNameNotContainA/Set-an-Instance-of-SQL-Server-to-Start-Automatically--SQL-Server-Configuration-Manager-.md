# Set an Instance of SQL Server to Start Automatically (SQL Server Configuration Manager)
This topic describes how to set an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] to start automatically in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] by using SQL Server Configuration Manager. During setup, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] is normally configured to start automatically. If this was not done, you can change that setting at any time.  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Configuration Manager  
  
#### To set an instance of SQL Server to start automatically  
  
1.  On the **Start** menu, point to **All Programs**, point to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrentUI](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrentUI_md.md)], point to **Configuration Tools**, and then click **SQL Server Configuration Manager**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Because [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Configuration Manager is a snap-in for the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] Management Console program and not a stand-alone program, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Configuration Manager does not appear as an application in newer versions of Windows.  
    >   
    >  -   **Windows 10**:  
    >          To open [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Configuration Manager, on the **Start Page**, type SQLServerManager13.msc (for [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL15_md.md)]). For previous versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] replace 13 with a smaller number. Clicking SQLServerManager13.msc opens the Configuration Manager. To pin the Configuration Manager to the Start Page or Task Bar, right-click SQLServerManager13.msc, and then click **Open file location**. In the Windows File Explorer, right-click SQLServerManager13.msc, and then click **Pin to Start** or **Pin to taskbar**.  
    > -   **Windows 8**:  
    >          To open [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Configuration Manager, in the **Search** charm, under **Apps**, type **SQLServerManager<version\>.msc** such as **SQLServerManager13.msc**, and then press **Enter**.  
  
2.  In **SQL Server Configuration Manager**, expand **Services**, and then click **SQL Server**.  
  
3.  In the details pane, right-click the name of the instance you want to start automatically, and then click **Properties**.  
  
4.  In the **SQL Server <***instancename***> Properties** dialog box, set **Start Mode** to **Automatic**.  
  
5.  Click **OK**, and then close [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Configuration Manager.
