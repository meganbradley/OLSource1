# Set Aggregation Options (Usage-Based Optimization Wizard)
  Use the **Set Aggregation Options** page to start the aggregation design process, and specify storage or performance limits for the aggregations generated by the Usage\-Based Optimization Wizard.  
  
## Options  
 **Estimated storage reaches**  
 Limit the aggregation design by indicating the maximum number of megabytes \(MB\) or gigabytes \(GB\) that can be used to generate the aggregations.  
  
 **Performance gain reaches**  
 Limit the aggregation design by indicating the maximum percentage of estimated performance gain that the aggregation design can provide. For best results, use the default setting of 100% for the performance gain value, unless disk space or processing time constraints prevent this.  
  
 **I click Stop**  
 Limit the aggregation design by clicking **Stop** during the design process.  
  
 **Start**  
 Start the aggregation design process.  
  
 **Stop**  
 End the aggregation design process.  
  
 **Reset**  
 Reset all the aggregation options on this page to their default values.
