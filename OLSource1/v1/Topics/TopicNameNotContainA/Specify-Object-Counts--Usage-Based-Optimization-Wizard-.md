# Specify Object Counts (Usage-Based Optimization Wizard)
Use the **Specify Object Counts** page to automatically calculate the count of objects in the cube or to manually enter estimated counts. The Usage-Based Optimization Wizard uses the object counts to estimate storage requirements.  
  
## Options  
 **Cube Objects**  
 Displays the dimensions and attributes in the cube. Only the attributes that do not have their **AggregationUsage** property set to None in the **Review Aggregation Usage** page of the wizard are shown because those are the only attributes that need counts specified.  
  
 **Estimated count**  
 Displays the estimated number of rows in the measure group and the estimated attribute member counts in the database dimensions. You can type a value to use as the estimated count or you can calculate the estimated count values. To calculate the count values, type 0 in the field and then click **Count**. Fields that already display a count are not updated.  
  
 **Partition count**  
 (Optional) Type the estimated number of rows in the measure group and the estimated attribute member counts in the partitions.  
  
 **Count**  
 Calculates and repopulates the values in the **Estimated count** column for all empty fields. Fields that already display a count are not updated.
