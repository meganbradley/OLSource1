# New Linked Report Page (Report Manager)
Use the New Linked Report page to create a linked report. A linked report is a report with settings and properties of its own, but links to the report definition of another report. Linked reports are useful when you have a base report that you want to vary for specific groups or users; for example, a regional report that returns different data based on a regional code that you specify as a parameter. A linked report is typically created from a parameterized report when you want to vary and then save different parameter values with each report instance. However, you can create a linked report from any report to which you have access.  
  
 A linked report can have its own name, description, location, parameter properties, report execution properties, report history properties, permissions, and subscriptions. However, a linked report must use the data source properties and layout of the base report that provides the report definition.  
  
## Navigation  
 Use the following procedures to navigate to this location in the user interface (UI).  
  
###### To open the New Linked Report page from the Contents page  
  
1.  Open Report Manager, and locate a report for which you want to create a linked report.  
  
2.  Hover over the report, and click the drop-down arrow.  
  
3.  In the drop-down menu, click **Create Linked Report**.  
  
###### To open the New Linked Report page from the General properties page of a report  
  
1.  Open Report Manager, and locate a report for which you want to create a linked report.  
  
2.  Hover over the report, and click the drop-down arrow.  
  
3.  In the drop-down menu, click **Manage**. This opens the General properties page for the report.  
  
4.  In the item toolbar, click **Create Linked Report**.  
  
## Options  
 **Name**  
 Specify the name of the linked report. A name must contain at least one alphanumeric character. It can also include spaces and certain symbols. However, you must not use the characters ; ? : @ & = + , $ / * < > &#124; " or / when specifying a name.  
  
 **Description**  
 Type a description of the report contents. This description appears in the Contents page to users who have permission to access the report.  
  
 **Location**  
 Specify the folder path that contains the report. By default, linked reports are created as siblings to the base report. Click **Change Location** to put the linked report in a different folder.  
  
 **OK**  
 Click **OK** to save your changes and return to the General properties page of the base report.
