# Error Page (Report Manager)
  Use the Error page to view details about an error condition. Serverâ€“based or session\-based errors appear on this page. Validation errors that relate to specific page controls display inline next to the control.  
  
-   If you are browsing to a local report server and you see errors similar to the following, see: [Configure a Native Mode Report Server for Local Administration &#40;SSRS&#41;](../Topic/Configure%20a%20Native%20Mode%20Report%20Server%20for%20Local%20Administration%20\(SSRS\).md)  
  
     User 'Domain\\\[user name\]' does not have required permissions. Verify that sufficient permissions have been granted and Windows User Account Control \(UAC\) restrictions have been addressed.  
  
-   If you see error messages similar to the following, see [Configure a Report Server for Remote Administration](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/Configure-a-Report-Server-for-Remote-Administration.md).  
  
     The machine could not be found. "The RPC server is unavailable. \(Exception from HRESULT: 0x800706BA\)".  
  
-   You can set server properties on a [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] report server to return additional information about error conditions that occur on remote servers. If an error message contains the text "For more information about this error, navigate to the report server on the local server machine, or enable remote errors", see [Enable Remote Errors &#40;Reporting Services&#41;](../Topic/Enable%20Remote%20Errors%20\(Reporting%20Services\).md).
