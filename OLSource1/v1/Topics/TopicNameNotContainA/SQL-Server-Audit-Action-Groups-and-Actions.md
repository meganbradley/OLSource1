# SQL Server Audit Action Groups and Actions
The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Audit feature enables you to audit server-level and database-level groups of events and individual events. For more information, see [SQL Server Audit (Database Engine)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/SQL-Server-Audit--Database-Engine-.md).  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] audits consist of zero or more audit action items. These audit action items can be either a group of actions, such as Server_Object_Change_Group, or individual actions such as SELECT operations on a table.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Server_Object_Change_Group includes CREATE, ALTER, and DROP for any server object (Database or Endpoint).  
  
 Audits can have the following categories of actions:  
  
-   Server-level. These actions include server operations, such as management changes and logon and logoff operations.  
  
-   Database-level. These actions encompass data manipulation languages (DML) and data definition language (DDL) operations.  
  
-   Audit-level. These actions include actions in the auditing process.  
  
 Some actions performed on [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] auditing components are intrinsically audited in a specific audit, and in these cases audit events occur automatically because the event occurred on the parent object.  
  
 The following actions are intrinsically audited:  
  
-   Server Audit State Change (setting State to ON or OFF)  
  
 The following events are not intrinsically audited:  
  
-   CREATE SERVER AUDIT SPECIFICATION  
  
-   ALTER SERVER AUDIT SPECIFICATION  
  
-   DROP SERVER AUDIT SPECIFICATION  
  
-   CREATE DATABASE AUDIT SPECIFICATION  
  
-   ALTER DATABASE AUDIT SPECIFICATION  
  
-   DROP DATABASE AUDIT SPECIFICATION  
  
 All audits are disabled when initially created.  
  
## Server-Level Audit Action Groups  
 Server-level audit action groups are actions similar to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] security audit event classes.

### Considerations  
 Server-level action groups cover actions across a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] instance. For example, any schema object access check in any database is recorded if the appropriate action group is added to a server audit specification. In a database audit specification, only schema object accesses in that database are recorded.  
  
 Server-level actions do not allow for detailed filtering on database-level actions. A database-level audit, such as audit of SELECT actions on the Customers table for logins in the Employee group is required to implement detailed action filtering. Do not include server-scoped objects, such as the system views, in a user database audit specification.

## Database-Level Audit Actions  
 Database-level actions support the auditing of specific actions directly on database schema and schema objects, such as Tables, Views, Stored Procedures, Functions, Extended Stored Procedures, Queues, Synonyms. Types, XML Schema Collection, Database, and Schema are not audited. The audit of schema objects may be configured on Schema and Database, which means that events on all schema objects contained by the specified schema or database will be audited. The following table describes database-level audit actions.  
  
|Action|Description|  
|------------|-----------------|  
|SELECT|This event is raised whenever a SELECT is issued.|  
|UPDATE|This event is raised whenever an UPDATE is issued.|  
|INSERT|This event is raised whenever an INSERT is issued.|  
|DELETE|This event is raised whenever a DELETE is issued.|  
|EXECUTE|This event is raised whenever an EXECUTE is issued.|  
|RECEIVE|This event is raised whenever a RECEIVE is issued.|  
|REFERENCES|This event is raised whenever a REFERENCES permission is checked.|  
  
### Considerations  
 Database-level audit actions do not apply to Columns.  
  
 When the query processor parameterizes the query, the parameter can appear in the audit event log instead of the column values of the query.  
  
## Audit-Level Audit Action Groups  
 You can also audit the actions in the auditing process. This can be in the server scope or the database scope. In the database scope, it only occurs for database audit specifications. The following table describes audit-level audit action groups.  
  
|Action group name|Description|  
|-----------------------|-----------------|  
|AUDIT_ CHANGE_GROUP|This event is raised whenever one of the following commands are issued:<br /><br /> CREATE SERVER AUDIT<br /><br /> ALTER SERVER AUDIT<br /><br /> DROP SERVER AUDIT<br /><br /> CREATE SERVER AUDIT SPECIFICATION<br /><br /> ALTER SERVER AUDIT SPECIFICATION<br /><br /> DROP SERVER AUDIT SPECIFICATION<br /><br /> CREATE DATABASE AUDIT SPECIFICATION<br /><br /> ALTER DATABASE AUDIT SPECIFICATION<br /><br /> DROP DATABASE AUDIT SPECIFICATION|
