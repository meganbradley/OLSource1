# Policy-Based Management Storage
Policies are stored in the msdb database. After a policy or condition is changed, msdb should be backed up. For more information, see [Back Up and Restore of System Databases (SQL Server)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Back-Up-and-Restore-of-System-Databases--SQL-Server-.md).  
  
## Storing Policies  
 [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] includes policies that can be used to monitor an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)]. By default, these policies are not installed on the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)]; however, they can be imported from the default installation location of C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\130\Tools\Policies\DatabaseEngine\1033.  
  
 You can directly create policies by using the **File/New** menu, and then saving them to a file. This enables you to create policies when you are not connected to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)].  
  
 Policy history for policies evaluated in the current instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)] is maintained in msdb system tables. Policy history for policies applied to other instances of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)] or applied to [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] is not retained.
