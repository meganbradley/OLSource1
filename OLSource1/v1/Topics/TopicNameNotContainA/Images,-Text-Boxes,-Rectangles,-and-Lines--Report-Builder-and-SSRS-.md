# Images, Text Boxes, Rectangles, and Lines (Report Builder and SSRS)
  In addition to data regions like tables, matrices, and charts, [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion_md](../../Token\Other/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] paginated reports use other report items like images, text boxes, and rectangles to add visual interest, highlight key information, or provide related information. You can change the formatting of a report item. For example, you can add a border or padding, change the initial visibility or direction, or specify an exact size and location for the item.

## In This Section  
 [Text Boxes &#40;Report Builder and SSRS&#41;](../Topic/Text%20Boxes%20\(Report%20Builder%20and%20SSRS\).md)  
 Text boxes can be placed anywhere on a report and can contain labels, fields, or calculated data. You use expressions to define the value to display in a text box when you view a report.  
  
 Every cell in a table or matrix is also a text box, which you can format in the same way that you format stand\-alone text boxes.  
  
 [Rectangles and Lines &#40;Report Builder and SSRS&#41;](../Topic/Rectangles%20and%20Lines%20\(Report%20Builder%20and%20SSRS\).md)  
 **Lines** display horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. A line is defined with a start and end point and can have various styles \(for example, weight and color\) assigned to it. A line has no data associated with it.  
  
 **Rectangles** can be used as a graphical element, or as a container for other report items. As a graphical element, a rectangle has the same properties as a line. As a container, a rectangle acts as a parent container for all report items inside it. Placing report items in a parent container helps control how they appear on each report page.  
  
 [Images &#40;Report Builder and SSRS&#41;](../Topic/Images%20\(Report%20Builder%20and%20SSRS\).md)  
 Images display binary image data in a report. You provide the source for the image. The source can be a URL reference to an image stored on a Web server, a reference to embedded image data, or a reference to binary image data in a database. Report Builder and Report Designer support .bmp, .jpeg, .gif, and .png files.
