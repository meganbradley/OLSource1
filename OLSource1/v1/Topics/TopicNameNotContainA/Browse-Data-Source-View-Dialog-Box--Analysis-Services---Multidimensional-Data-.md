# Browse Data Source View Dialog Box (Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data)
  The Browse Data Source View dialog box displays a simple graphical diagram of the selected data source view. Also, the name of the data source view appears as the title of the dialog box.

To change which portion of the data source view appears in the diagram, click the navigation button \(a four\-headed arrow\) in the lower\-right corner and then drag the selection pane to the area that you want to display.
