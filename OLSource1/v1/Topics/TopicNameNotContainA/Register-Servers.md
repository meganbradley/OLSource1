# Register Servers
  Registering a server in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] allows you to store the server connection information for future connections.There are three ways to register a server in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssManStudioFull_md.md)].  
  
1.  Local instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] are automatically registered during the first launch of [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../Token\Other/ssManStudio_md.md)] after its installation.  
  
2.  You can also initiate the automatic registration process at any time, to restore the registration of local server instances.  
  
3.  Lastly, you can register a server using the Registered Servers tool in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssManStudioFull_md.md)].  
  
## Benefits of Registered Servers

-   Edit or delete the registration information for a registered server.  
  
-   Create groups of servers.  
  
-   Provide user\-friendly names for registered servers by providing a value in the **Registered server name** box that is different from the **Server name** list.  
  
-   Provide detailed descriptions for registered servers.  
  
-   Provide detailed descriptions of registered server groups.  
  
-   Export registered server groups.  
  
-   Import registered server groups.  
  
-   View the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] log files for online or offline instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)].
