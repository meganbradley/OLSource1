# Prepare SQL Server for CDC
The Oracle CDC service requires all target [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] instances to contain the MSXDBCDC database. You create this database using the Prepare SQL Server action in the CDC Service Configuration Console. This creates a special script that is run to create the required tables, stored procedures, and other required artifacts for this database. This task is done one time only for each target [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] instance.  
  
 For more information about the MSXDBCDC database, see The MSXDBCDC Database.  
  
 In the CDC Service Configuration Console, click **Prepare SQL Server**. If this option is not available, make sure that **Local CDC Services** is selected in the left pane of the console.  
  
## Options  
  
### Server Name  
 Type the name of the server where the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] is located.  
  
### Authentication  
 Select one of the following:  
  
-   **Windows Authentication**  
  
-   **SQL Server Authentication**: If you select this option, you must type the **User Name** and **Password** for the user in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] you are connecting to.  
  
 To prepare the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] instance for Oracle CDC, the login must have write permission to the MSXDBCDC database. Enter the credentials for a login that has write permission to the MSXDBCDC database, such as a member of the `sysasmin` role.  
  
### Options  
 Click the arrow to view available options to be configured. You can choose to leave these options with their default value. The available options are:  
  
-   **Connection Timeout**: Type the time (in seconds) that the CDC Service for Oracle waits for a connection to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] before timing out. The default value is **15**.  
  
-   **Execution Timeout**: Type the time (in seconds) that the Oracle CDC Windows Service waits for a command to execute before timing out. The default value is **30**.  
  
-   **Encrypt Connection**: Select **Encrypt Connection** for communication between the Oracle CDC Service and the target [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] instance using an encrypted connection.  
  
-   **Advanced**: Type any additional connection properties, if necessary.  
  
### View Script  
 Click **View Script** to view a read-only version of the setup script. A [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] system administrator can copy this script into the SQL Server Management Console to edit it, if necessary. For more information about the Prepare SQL Server Script, see [Prepare SQL Server for Oracle CDC-View Script](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Prepare-SQL-Server-for-Oracle-CDC-View-Script.md).
