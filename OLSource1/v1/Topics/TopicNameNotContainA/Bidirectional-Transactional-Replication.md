# Bidirectional Transactional Replication
Bidirectional transactional replication is a specific transactional replication topology that allows two servers to exchange changes with each other: each server publishes data and then subscribes to a publication with the same data from the other server. The **@loopback_detection** parameter of [Peer-to-Peer Transactional Replication](assetId:///61ddf287-1fa0-4c1a-8657-ced50cebf0e0) is set to TRUE to ensure that changes are only sent to the Subscriber and do not result in the change being sent back to the Publisher.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssVersion2005_md.md)] and later versions, this topology is also supported by peer-to-peer transactional replication, but bidirectional replication can provide improved performance.
