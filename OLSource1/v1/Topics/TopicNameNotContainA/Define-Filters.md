# Define Filters
  The **Define Filters** dialog box allows you to define filters that you then apply to data conflicts to see a subset of the conflicts in the grid. To define a filter, choose an operator from the **Operator** drop\-down list box and then enter a value. For example, to show only those conflicts in which the conflict loser is server **ReplTest1**, select **Equal to** from the **Operator** drop\-down list box and enter **ReplTest1** in the first **Value** column.  
  
## Options  
 **Operator**  
 Select an operator for the filter, such as **Less than or Equal to**.  
  
 **Value**  
 Enter a value for the filter. Most operators only require a value in the first **Value** column, but the **Between** and **Not Between** operators require a value in both of the **Value** columns.  
  
 **Clear**  
 Click this button to clear all filters that have been previously defined.
