# Manage Business Rules (MDS Add-in for Excel)
In the Master Data Services Add-in for Excel you can manage Business Rules which can be used to [validate data](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Validating-Data--MDS-Add-in-for-Excel-.md).  
  
 In the MDS Add-in, the **Business Rules** button in the ribbon is enabled after you connect to a server, select a model, version, and entity in the explorer pane, and load the sheet with entity members. When you click on this button, the **Business Rules** panel opens with a list of existing Business Rules for the selected entity.  
  
 From the **Business Rules** panel command bar at the top, you can **Create**, **Edit**, **Delete**, **Increase (Move Up)**, and **Decrease (Move Down)** the priority of a Business Rule.  
  
 When you click on the **Create** or **Edit** button, the **Business Rule Editor** dialog opens. From here you can define [Business Rule Conditions (Master Data Services)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Business-Rule-Conditions--Master-Data-Services-.md) and [Business Rule Actions (Master Data Services)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Business-Rule-Actions--Master-Data-Services-.md).  
  
 To exclude a business rule, click the toggle button next to the  rule to set it to the **Excluded** state. To include the business rule (reactivate it), click the toggle button to set the rule to the **Active** state.  
  
 For more information, see [Business Rules (Master Data Services)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Business-Rules--Master-Data-Services-.md).
