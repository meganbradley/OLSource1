# Manage Business Rules (MDS Add-in for Excel)
  In the Master Data Services Add\-in for Excel you can manage Business Rules which can be used to [validate data](../Topic/Validating%20Data%20\(MDS%20Add-in%20for%20Excel\).md).  
  
 In the MDS Add\-in, the **Business Rules** button in the ribbon is enabled after you connect to a server, select a model, version, and entity in the explorer pane, and load the sheet with entity members. When you click on this button, the **Business Rules** panel opens with a list of existing Business Rules for the selected entity.  
  
 From the **Business Rules** panel command bar at the top, you can **Create**, **Edit**, **Delete**, **Increase \(Move Up\)**, and **Decrease \(Move Down\)** the priority of a Business Rule.  
  
 When you click on the **Create** or **Edit** button, the **Business Rule Editor** dialog opens. From here you can define [Business Rule Conditions &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../Topic/Business%20Rule%20Conditions%20\(Master%20Data%20Services\).md) and [Business Rule Actions &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../Topic/Business%20Rule%20Actions%20\(Master%20Data%20Services\).md).  
  
 To exclude a business rule, click the toggle button next to the  rule to set it to the **Excluded** state. To include the business rule \(reactivate it\), click the toggle button to set the rule to the **Active** state.  
  
 For more information, see [Business Rules &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../Topic/Business%20Rules%20\(Master%20Data%20Services\).md).
