# The following features are not supported by Excel Services and may not display or may display only partially: Comments, Shapes, or other objects
This error occurs when you add Slicers to a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssGemini_md.md)] workbook from a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssGemini_md.md)] Field List.  
  
## Details  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Applies to|[!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssGemini_md.md)] for SharePoint|  
|Product Version|[!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssKilimanjaro_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL11_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL14_md.md)]|  
|Cause|Excel Web Access cannot render the Shape object used to control positioning and formatting of Slicers added to a workbook from the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssGemini_md.md)] Field List.|  
|Message Text|The following features are not supported by Excel Services and may not display or may display only partially:<br /><br /> Comments, Shapes, or other objects<br /><br /> Some features, such as external data queries, display cached data which can only be refreshed in Microsoft Excel.|  
  
## Explanation  
 Excel Web Access shows this error when you open a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssGemini_md.md)] workbook in a browser and you click the **Details** button for the message, **Unsupported Features This workbook may not display as intended**.  
  
 This error occurs because the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssGemini_md.md)] workbook contains Slicers whose layout is controlled by a hidden Shape object in Excel. The Shape object controls the formatting and positioning of the Slicers in horizontal and vertical placements.  
  
 Excel Services cannot render a Shape object, but because the object is hidden, the fact that it does not render is not an issue.  
  
## User Action  
 This error can be ignored. Click **OK** to close the error message and proceed to use the workbook and Slicers with no problem.
