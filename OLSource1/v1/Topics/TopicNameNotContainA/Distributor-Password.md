# Distributor Password
  If, on the **Publishers** page of this wizard, you enabled one or more Publishers to use this server as a remote Distributor, you must specify a password for the connection replication makes between the Publisher and the remote Distributor using the **distributor\_admin** login. The same password must be entered for each Publisher that uses this remote Distributor on the **Administrative Password** page of the New Publication Wizard or the Configure Distribution Wizard. For more information on security for Distributors, see [Secure the Distributor](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/Secure-the-Distributor.md).  
  
## Options  
 **Password**  
 Enter a strong password for the connection between the Publisher and the remote Distributor.  
  
 **Confirm Password**  
 Re\-enter the password to confirm it was entered correctly.
