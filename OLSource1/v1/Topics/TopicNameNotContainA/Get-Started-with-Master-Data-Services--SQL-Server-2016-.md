# Get Started with Master Data Services (SQL Server 2016)
This article covers how to install  [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)], set up the MDS database and website, and deploy the sample models and data.  
  
 For an overview of the building blocks of [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)], such as a model and an entity, see [Master Data Services Overview (MDS)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Master-Data-Services-Overview--MDS-.md).  
  
## Installing Master Data Services, and IIS Roles and Features  
 You use the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] setup installation wizard or a command prompt to install [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)].  
  
 **To install [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)] using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Setup.**

##  <a name="deploySample"></a> Deploying Sample Models and Data  
 The following three sample model packages are included with  [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)].   These sample models include data. The default location for the sample model packages is *<drive\>*\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\130\Master Data Services\Samples\Packages.  
  
-   chartofaccounts_en.pkg  
  
-   customer_en.pkg  
  
-   product_en.pkg  
  
 You deploy the packages using the MDSModelDeploy tool. The default location for the MDSModelDeploy tool is *<drive\>*\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\ 130\Master Data Services\Configuration.  
  
 For information about prerequisites for running this tool, see [Deploy a Model Deployment Package by Using MDSModelDeploy](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Deploy-a-Model-Deployment-Package-by-Using-MDSModelDeploy.md).  
  
 For information about updates made to the data to support new features in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)], see [Samples: Model Deployment Packages (Master Data Services)](../Topic/Samples:%20Model%20Deployment%20Packages%20\(Master%20Data%20Services\).md).  
  
 **To deploy the sample models**  
  
1.  Copy the sample model packages to <drive\>\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\130\Master Data Services\Configuration.  
  
2.  Open an Administrator: Command Prompt and navigate to MDSModelDeploy.exe, by running the following command.  
  
    ```  
    cd c:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\130\Master Data Services\Configuration  
    ```  
  
3.  Deploy each of the sample models to [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)] by running each of the following commands.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  In the examples below, the `MDS1` service value is specified. You use this value if you selected  **Default Web Site** when you set up the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)] Web site.  See the [Setting up the Database and Website](#SetUpWeb) section.  
    >   
    >  If you created a new web site or selected another existing web site, run the following command first to determine the correct service value.  
    >   
    >  `MDSModelDeploy listservices`  
    >   
    >  The first service value in the list of values returned, is the one you specify to deploy a model.  
  
     **To deploy the chartofaccounts_en.pkg sample model**  
  
    ```  
    MDSModelDeploy deploynew -package chartofaccounts_en.pkg -model Customer -service MDS1  
    ```  
  
     **To deploy the customer_en.pkg sample model**  
  
    ```  
    MDSModelDeploy deploynew -package customer_en.pkg -model Customer -service MDS1  
    ```  
  
     **To deploy the product_en.pkg sample model**  
  
    ```  
    MDSModelDeploy deploynew -package product_en.pkg -model Customer -service MDS1  
  
    ```  
  
     When a model is successfully deployed, the **MDSModelDeploy operation completed** message is displayed.  
  
     The following image shows the command for deploying the product_en.pkg sample model.  
  
     ![Command line for deploying the Product sample model](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/media/mds_CommandPrompt_DeployingSampleModel_Product.png "mds_CommandPrompt_DeployingSampleModel_Product")  
  
4.  To view the sample models, do the following.  
  
    1.  Navigate to the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)] web site that you set up. See the [Setting up the Database and Website](#SetUpWeb) section.  
  
         The web site address is http://<server name\>/<web application\>/.  
  
    2.  Select a model from the **Model** list box, and click **Explorer**.
