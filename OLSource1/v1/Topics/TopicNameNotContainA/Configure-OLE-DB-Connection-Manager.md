# Configure OLE DB Connection Manager
Use the **Configure OLE DB Connection Manager** dialog box to add a connection to a data source, which can be either a new connection or a copy of an existing connection.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If the data source is [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] Office Excel 2007, the data source requires a different connection manager than earlier versions of Excel. For more information, see [Connect to an Excel Workbook](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Connect-to-an-Excel-Workbook.md).  
>   
>  If the data source is [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] Office Access 2007, the data source requires a different OLE DB provider than earlier versions of Access. For more information, see [Connect to an Access Database](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Connect-to-an-Access-Database.md).
