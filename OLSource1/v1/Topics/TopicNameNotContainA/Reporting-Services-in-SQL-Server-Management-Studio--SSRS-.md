# Reporting Services in SQL Server Management Studio (SSRS)
Report server administrators can use [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] to:  
  
-   Enable features, set server defaults, and manage running jobs.  
  
-   View and create custom reports. In Object Explorer, many nodes display a set of standard reports that are installed with [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudio_md.md)]. You must have administrator permissions. The schema of a custom report must match the schema of the installed reports. For more information, see [Custom Reports in Management Studio](assetId:///1ba3f758-f39b-4f5f-91ca-516cedc78979) and [Find the Report Definition Schema Version (SSRS)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Find-the-Report-Definition-Schema-Version--SSRS-.md).  
  
 Report authors can use [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudio_md.md)] to:  
  
-   Visualize spatial data from a query result set for a map report. After you run the query, use the **Spatial results** tab in the result set pane. For more information, see [View Spatial Data in Object Explorer](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/View-Spatial-Data-in-Object-Explorer.md).  
  
 This section contains step-by-step instructions for performing various reporting tasks using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudio_md.md)]. Creating and managing shared schedules can also be performed using Report Manager.
