# Security Considerations for SQL Server Compact Replication
Securing connectivity between an instance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Database Engine and [!INCLUDE[ssEW](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssEW_md.md)] involves properly configuring security for both Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) and [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)].
