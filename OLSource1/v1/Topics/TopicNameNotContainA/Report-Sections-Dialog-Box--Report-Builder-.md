# Report Sections Dialog Box (Report Builder)
When you open a report, Report Builder verifies that the report contains only one Report Definition Language (RDL) **<Section\>** element. Opening a report with multiple **<Section\>** elements is not supported.  
  
 Although a report definition with multiple sections can be generated programmatically, editing the report in a report authoring environment is not supported.  
  
 To identify the current report definition format for a report, for a report server, for a project, or for your report authoring environment, see [Find the Report Definition Schema Version (SSRS)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Find-the-Report-Definition-Schema-Version--SSRS-.md).  
  
 Click **OK** to continue.
