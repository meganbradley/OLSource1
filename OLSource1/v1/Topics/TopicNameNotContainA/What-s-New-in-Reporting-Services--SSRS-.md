## PowerPoint Rendering and Export  
 **[CTP 2.4]** The Microsoft PowerPoint (PPTX) format is a new [!INCLUDE[ssRSCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSCurrent_md.md)] rendering extension.

|-|-|  
|**[CTP 2.4]** The report viewer toolbar ActiveX print experience has been replaced with a modern PDF based experience that works across the matrix of supported browsers, including Microsoft Edge.<br /> No more ActiveX controls to download! Depending on the browser you use and the PDF viewing applications and services you have installed, [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] will either open  a print dialog to print your report or prompt you to download a .PDF file of your report.  As an administrator, you can still disable client side printing from [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudio_md.md)]. For more information, see [Enable and Disable Client-Side Printing for Reporting Services](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Enable-and-Disable-Client-Side-Printing-for-Reporting-Services.md).|![ssrs&#95;pdfprint&#95;firefox2](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/media/ssrs_pdfprint_firefox2.png "ssrs_pdfprint_firefox2")|

The new rendering engine is used by default but you have the option of switching back to the previous rendering engine and providing feedback to Microsoft on the new HTML5 approach.  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|![ssrs&#95;html5&#95;bubble](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/media/ssrs_html5_bubble.png "ssrs_html5_bubble")|When you preview reports in Report Manager,   you will see an information bubble noting you are using the new HTML 5, full standards rendering but you can switch to the old rendering engine.  The bubble appears the fist few times you preview a report.|  
|![ssrs&#95;html5&#95;switch2compat](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/media/ssrs_html5_switch2compat.png "ssrs_html5_switch2compat")<br /><br /> ![ssrs&#95;html5&#95;switch2html5](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/media/ssrs_html5_switch2html5.png "ssrs_html5_switch2html5")|The ribbon allows you to toggle between:<br /><br /> -Comparability mode and running the old rendering engine.<br /><br /> -Preview of the new HTML 5 rendering mode<br /><br /> <br /><br /> To provide feedback on the new rendering engine, see the MSDN forum [SQL Server Reporting services](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=620231).|

## New Report Builder User Interface  
 **[CTP 2.3]** The core [!INCLUDE[ssRBnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRBnoversion_md.md)] user interface is now a modern look and feel with streamlined UI elements.  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|New|Previous|  
|![ssrs&#95;rbfacelift&#95;new](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/media/ssrs_rbfacelift_new.png "ssrs_rbfacelift_new")|![ssrs&#95;rbfacelift&#95;old](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/media/ssrs_rbfacelift_old.png "ssrs_rbfacelift_old")|  
  
## Tree Map and Sunburst Charts  
 **[CTP 2.3]**. Enhance your reports with Tree Map ![ssrs&#95;treemap&#95;icon](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/media/ssrs_treemap_icon.png "ssrs_treemap_icon") and Sunburst ![ssrs&#95;sunburst&#95;icon](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/media/ssrs_sunburst_icon.png "ssrs_sunburst_icon") charts, great ways to display hierarchal data.  
  
 For more information, see [Tree Map and Sunburst Charts in Reporting Services](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Tree-Map-and-Sunburst-Charts-in-Reporting-Services.md).  
  
 ![horizontal&#95;bar](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/media/horizontal_bar.png "horizontal_bar")  
  
## Microsoft .NET Framework 4 Support  
 **[CTP 2.0]** [!INCLUDE[ssRSCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSCurrent_md.md)] supports the current versions of Microsoft .NET Framework 4. This includes version 4.0 and 4.5.1. If no version of .Net Framework 4.x is installed, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] setup installs .NET 4.0 during the feature installation step.  
  
## High DPI Support  
 **[CTP 2.0]** [!INCLUDE[ssRBnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRBnoversion_md.md)] for [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] supports High DPI (Dots Per Inch) scaling and devices.  For more information on High DPI, see the following:

## Subscription Improvements  
 **[CTP 2.0]** Enhancements to [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] Subscription features:  
  
|Feature|Supported server mode|  
|-------------|---------------------------|  
|**Enable and disable subscriptions**. New user interface options to quickly disable and enable subscriptions. The disabled subscriptions maintain their other configuration properties such as schedule and can be easily enabled.<br /><br /> ![reporting services subscription ribbon](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/media/ssrs_subscription_ribbon.png "ssrs_subscription_ribbon")<br /><br /> For more information, see [Disable or Pause Report and Subscription Processing](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Disable-or-Pause-Report-and-Subscription-Processing.md).|Native mode|  
|**Subscription description**. When you create a new subscription, you can now include a description of the report as part of the subscription properties. The description is included on the subscription summary page.|SharePoint and Native mode|  
|**Change subscription owner**. Enhanced user interface to quickly change the owner of a subscription. Previous versions of [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] allow administrators to change subscription owners using script. Starting with the [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL15_md.md)] release, you can change subscription owners using the user interface or script. Changing the subscription owner is a common administrative task when users leave or change roles in your organization.|SharePoint and Native mode|  
|**Shared credential for file share subscriptions**. Two workflows now exist with [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] file share subscriptions:<br /><br /> New in this release, your [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] administrator can configure a single file share account, that is used for one to many subscriptions. The file share account is configured in the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] native mode configuration manager **Specify a file share account**, and then on the subscription configuration page, users select **Use file share account**.<br /><br /> Configure individual subscriptions with specific credentials for the destination file share.<br /><br /> You can also mix the two approaches and have some file share subscriptions use the central file share account while other subscriptions use specific credentials.|Native mode|
