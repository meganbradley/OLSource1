|Symbolic Name||  
|Message Text|Could not drop the Distributor '%s'. This Distributor has associated distribution databases.|  
  
## Explanation  
 A [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] instance that is configured as a Distributor cannot be removed from the role of Distributor because there are distribution databases associated with the instance. This error occurs if you attempt to drop a distribution database that is associated with one or more Publishers.  
  
## User Action  
 To find the names of any Publishers and distribution databases associated with this Distributor, execute [sp_helpdistpublisher (Transact-SQL)](assetId:///f207c22d-8fb2-4756-8a9d-6c51d6cd3470) from any database on the Distributor.  
  
 Execute [sp_dropdistributiondb (Transact-SQL)](assetId:///b6dd1846-2259-4d29-93af-a70a5d25a0c5) for any distribution databases associated with this Distributor. After all distribution database associations are removed, you can disable distribution.
