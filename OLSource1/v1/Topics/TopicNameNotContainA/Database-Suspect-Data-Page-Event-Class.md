# Database Suspect Data Page Event Class
The **Database Suspect Data Page** event class indicates when a page is added to the [suspect_pages](assetId:///119c8d62-eea8-44fb-bf72-de469c838c50) table in [msdb](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/msdb-Database.md). Include this event class in traces that are monitoring the occurrence of suspect pages.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This event is issued asynchronously from the insertion of a corresponding row into the **suspect_pages** table. Therefore, a job listening on this event might not find the corresponding **suspect_pages** entry immediately.  
  
 When the **Database Suspect Data Page** event class is included in a trace the relative overhead is low. The overhead might be greater if the number of suspect pages increases, for example, if a disk drive is experiencing problems.
