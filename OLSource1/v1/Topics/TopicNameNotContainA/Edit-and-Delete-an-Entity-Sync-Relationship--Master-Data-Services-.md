# Edit and Delete an Entity Sync Relationship (Master Data Services)
Entity sync is a one-way and repeatable synchronization between entity versions. It provides a way to share entity data between different models. You can edit and delete a sync relationship that you've created.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 Prerequisites to edit an entity sync relationship.  
  
-   You must have permission to access the System Administration functional area. For more information, see [Functional Area Permissions (Master Data Services)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Functional-Area-Permissions--Master-Data-Services-.md).  
  
-   You must be a model administrator of the target model. For more information, see [Administrators (Master Data Services)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Administrators--Master-Data-Services-.md).  
  
-   You must have at least read access to the source entity and all its attributes and members.

-   You must be a model administrator of the target model. For more information, see [Administrators (Master Data Services)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Administrators--Master-Data-Services-.md).  
  
 Consider the following when editing an entity sync relationship.  
  
-   The source and target entities must be in different models.  
  
-   A target entity version status must not be committed.  
  
-   Once a sync relationship has been established, the target is immediately synced with the source.  
  
-   A target entity version cannot be a source entity version of another sync relationship.  
  
 Consider the following when executing an entity sync relationship  
  
-   Only leaf members will be copied.  
  
-   Domain-based attributes will not be copied.  
  
-   Soft-deleted members will not be copied.  
  
-   Sync does not generate target entity transactions/histories.
