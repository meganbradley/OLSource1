# XMLA Query Editor (Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data)
Use the XMLA Query Editor to design and execute statements and scripts written in the Multidimensional Expressions (XMLA) language.  
  
## Features  
  
-   Type scripts in the query editor pane of XMLA Query Editor.  
  
-   To execute scripts press **F5**, or click **Execute** on the toolbar, or on the **Query** menu, click **Execute**. If a portion of the code is selected, only that portion is executed. If no code is selected, the entire content of the XMLA Query Editor is executed.  
  
-   View metadata for cubes and other objects contained in an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] database in the metadata pane.  
  
-   For help with XMLA syntax, select a keyword in XMLA Query Editor, and then click **F1**.  
  
-   For dynamic help with XMLA syntax, on the **Help** menu, click **Dynamic Help** to open the Dynamic Help component. With Dynamic Help, help topics appear in the **Dynamic Help** window when keywords are typed in Query Editor.
