# View Foreign Key Properties
  You can view the foreign key attributes of a relationship in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Token\Other/ssCurrent_md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Token\Other/tsql_md.md)].

-   **To view the foreign key attributes of a specific table, using:**

##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio  
  
#### To view the foreign key attributes of a relationship in a specific table  
  
1.  Open the Table Designer for the table containing the foreign key you want to view, right\-click in the Table Designer, and choose **Relationships** from the shortcut menu.  
  
2.  In the **Foreign Key Relationships** dialog box, select the relationship with properties you want to view.  
  
 If the foreign key columns are related to a primary key, the primary key columns are identified in **Table Designer** by a primary key symbol in the row selector.  
  
##  <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a> Using Transact\-SQL  
  
#### To view the foreign key attributes of a relationship in a specific table  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Token\Other/ssDE_md.md)].  
  
2.  On the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and clickÂ **Execute**. The example returns all foreign keys and their properties for the table `HumanResources.Employee` in the sample database.  
  
    ```  
    USE AdventureWorks2012;  
    GO  
    SELECT   
        f.name AS foreign_key_name  
       ,OBJECT_NAME(f.parent_object_id) AS table_name  
       ,COL_NAME(fc.parent_object_id, fc.parent_column_id) AS constraint_column_name  
       ,OBJECT_NAME (f.referenced_object_id) AS referenced_object  
       ,COL_NAME(fc.referenced_object_id, fc.referenced_column_id) AS referenced_column_name  
       ,is_disabled  
       ,delete_referential_action_desc  
       ,update_referential_action_desc  
    FROM sys.foreign_keys AS f  
    INNER JOIN sys.foreign_key_columns AS fc   
       ON f.object_id = fc.constraint_object_id   
    WHERE f.parent_object_id = OBJECT_ID('HumanResources.Employee');  
    ```
