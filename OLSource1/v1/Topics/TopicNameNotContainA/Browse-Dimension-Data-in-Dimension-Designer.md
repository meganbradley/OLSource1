# Browse Dimension Data in Dimension Designer
You can browse the data in a dimension by using the **Browser** view in Dimension Designer, which is accessed from [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)].  
  
 In order for dimension data to be displayed in the **Browser** view, the dimension must be in a processed state. For more information, see [Processing a multidimensional model (Analysis Services)](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Processing-a-multidimensional-model--Analysis-Services-.md).  
  
### To browse a dimension in SQL Server Data Tools  
  
1.  Open the dimension that you want to browse, and click the **Browser** tab.  
  
2.  In the **Hierarchy** drop-down list, choose the hierarchy for which you want to browse data.  
  
3.  Optionally, if your dimension includes translations, in the **Language** drop-down list, choose the language in which you want to display the data.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You must have a translation defined in the dimension for the selected language.
