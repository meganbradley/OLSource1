# Commonly Used Filters (Report Builder and SSRS)
  To create a filter, you must specify one or more filter equations. A filter equation includes an expression, a data type, an operator, and a value. This topic provides examples of commonly used filters.

## Filter Examples  
 The following table shows examples of filter equations that use different data types and different operators. The scope for the comparison is determined by report item for which a filter is defined. For example, for a filter defined on a dataset, **TOP % 10** is the top 10 percent of values in the dataset; for a filter defined on a group, **TOP % 10** is the top 10 percent of values in the group.  
  
|Simple Expression|Data Type|Operator|Value|Description|  
|-----------------------|---------------|--------------|-----------|-----------------|  
|`[SUM(Quantity)]`|**Integer**|**\>**|`7`|Includes data values that are greater than 7.|  
|`[SUM(Quantity)]`|**Integer**|**TOP N**|`10`|Includes the top 10 data values.|  
|`[SUM(Quantity)]`|**Integer**|**TOP %**|`20`|Includes the top 20% of data values.|  
|`[Sales]`|**Text**|**\>**|`=CDec(100)`|Includes all values of type System.Decimal \(SQL "money" data types\) greater than $100.|  
|`[OrderDate]`|**DateTime**|**\>**|`2088-01-01`|Includes all dates from January 1, 2008 to the present date.|  
|`[OrderDate]`|**DateTime**|**BETWEEN**|`2008-01-01`<br /><br /> `2008-02-01`|Includes dates from January 1, 2008 up to and including February 1, 2008.|  
|`[Territory]`|**Text**|**LIKE**|`*east`|All territory names that end in "east".|  
|`[Territory]`|**Text**|**LIKE**|`%o%th*`|All territory names that include North and South at the beginning of the name.|  
|`=LEFT(Fields!Subcat.Value,1)`|**Text**|**IN**|`B, C, T`|All subcategory values that begin with the letters B, C, or T.|  
  
## Examples with Report Parameters  
 The following table provides examples of filter expression that includes a single\-value or multivalue parameter reference.  
  
|Parameter type|\(Filter\) Expression|Operator|Value|Data Type|  
|--------------------|---------------------------|--------------|-----------|---------------|  
|Single value|`[EmployeeID]`|\=|`[@EmployeeID]`|Integer|  
|Multivalue|`[EmployeeID]`|IN|`[@EmployeeID]`|Integer|
