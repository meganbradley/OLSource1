# Show Hidden Datasets for Parameter Values for Multidimensional Data (Report Builder and SSRS)
  Your report might include automatically\-generated datasets \(also known as hidden datasets\) that do not appear by default in the Report Data pane. These datasets are created in the following ways:  
  
-   In some query designers for multidimensional databases, you can specify fields to filter on in the filter area of the query pane, and select whether to create a query parameter for the filter. If you select the parameter option, report datasets are automatically created to provide valid values for the report parameter.  
  
-   If you import a query based on multidimensional databases, you might also include hidden datasets in your report.  
  
 Hidden datasets are not available to use from a wizard.  
  
 You can change the view in the Report Data pane to display all datasets in the report.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  [!INCLUDE[ssRBRDDup](../../Token\Other/ssRBRDDup_md.md)]  
  
### To display hidden datasets  
  
-   In the Report Data pane, right\-click the Datasets folder, and then click **Show Hidden Datasets**.
