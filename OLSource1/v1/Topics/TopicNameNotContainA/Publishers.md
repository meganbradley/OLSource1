# Publishers
You can give permission for other Publishers to use this Distributor. Be aware that enabling a Publisher to use this server as its remote Distributor does not make that server a Publisher. You must connect to the Publisher, configure it for publishing, and choose this server as the Distributor. You can configure the Publisher and choose a Distributor through the New Publication Wizard.  
  
 The servers you select as Publishers will use the distribution database specified on the **Distribution Database** page of this wizard. If you want to use a different distribution database, do not enable the Publisher at this time. Instead, use the **Distributor Properties** dialog box to add Publishers after you complete the Configure Distribution Wizard.  
  
## Options  
 **Publishers**  
 Select the servers that are allowed to use this Distributor. Click the properties button (**...**) next to a Publisher to view and set additional properties.  
  
 **Add**  
 If the server you want to allow is not listed, click **Add** to add a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Publisher or Oracle Publisher to the list of available Publishers.
