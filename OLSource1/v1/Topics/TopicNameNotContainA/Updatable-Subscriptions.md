# Updatable Subscriptions
With transactional replication, replicated data should be treated as read-only; however, you can modify replicated data at a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Subscriber by using updatable subscriptions. If you need to modify data at the Subscriber, choose one of the following options depending on your requirements.  
  
|Updatable Subscription Type|Requirements|  
|---------------------------------|------------------|  
|Immediate Updating|Publisher and Subscriber must be connected to update data at the Subscriber.|  
|Queued Updating|Publisher and Subscriber do not have to be connected to update data at the Subscriber. Updates can be made while offline, and later synchronized between the Publisher and Subscriber.|  
  
## Options  
 **Replicate Subscriber changes**  
 Select the check box in the **Replicate** column for each Subscriber that should be able to make updates. For those Subscribers that can make updates, select the appropriate option from the drop-down list box in the **Commit at Publisher** column:  
  
-   Select **Simultaneously commit changes** for an immediate updating subscription.  
  
-   Select **Queue changes and commit when possible** for a queued updating subscription.
