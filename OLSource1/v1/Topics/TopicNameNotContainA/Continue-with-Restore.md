# Continue with Restore
  Use the **Continue with Restore** dialog box to indicate whether you want to restore the next backup set. To delay the restore operation, for example, to swap tapes, wait until you are ready to proceed before you click **OK**.  
  
 Clicking **No** terminates the restore sequence, leaving the database in the restoring state. To continue with the restore later, use either the **Restore Database** or **Restore Transaction Log** task, as appropriate.  
  
## Options  
 **Media set**  
 Displays the next media set name \(if available\).  
  
 **Backup set**  
 Displays the backup set name.  
  
 **Backup set description**  
 Displays the backup set description.
