# SQL Server, General Statistics Object
The **SQLServer:General Statistics** object in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] provides counters to monitor general server-wide activity, such as the number of current connections and the number of users connecting and disconnecting per second from computers running an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)]. This can be useful when you are working on large online transaction processing (OLTP) type systems where there are many clients connecting and disconnecting from an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)].  
  
 This table describes the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] **General Statistics** counters.  
  
|SQL Server General Statistics counters|Description|  
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------|  
|**Active Temp Tables**|Number of temporary tables/table variables in use.|  
|**Connection resets/sec**|Total number of logins started from the connection pool.|  
|**Event Notifications Delayed Drop**|Number of event notifications waiting to be dropped by a system thread.|  
|**HTTP Authenticated Requests**|Number of authenticated HTTP requests started per second.|  
|**Logical Connections**|Number of logical connections to the system.<br /><br /> The main purpose of logical connections is to service multiple active result sets (MARS) requests. For MARS requests, every time that an application makes a connection to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)], there may be more than one logical connection that corresponds to a physical connection.<br /><br /> When MARS is not used, the ratio between physical and logical connections is 1:1. Therefore, every time that an application makes a connection to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)], logical connections will increase by 1.|  
|**Logins/sec**|Total number of logins started per second. This does not include pooled connections.|  
|**Logouts/sec**|Total number of logout operations started per second.|  
|**Mars Deadlocks**|Number of MARS deadlocks detected.|  
|**Non-atomic yield rate**|Number of non-atomic yields per second.|  
|**Processes blocked**|Number of currently blocked processes.|  
|**SOAP Empty Requests**|Number of empty SOAP requests started per second.|  
|**SOAP Method Invocations**|Number of SOAP method invocations started per second.|  
|**SOAP Session Initiate Requests**|Number of SOAP Session initiate requests started per second.|  
|**SOAP Session Terminate Requests**|Number of SOAP Session terminate requests started per second.|  
|**SOAP SQL Requests**|Number of SOAP SQL requests started per second.|  
|**SOAP WSDL Requests**|Number of SOAP Web Service Description Language requests started per second.|  
|**Temp Tables Creation Rate**|Number of temporary tables/table variables created per second.|  
|**Temp Tables For Destruction**|Number of temporary tables/table variables waiting to be destroyed by the cleanup system thread.|  
|**Trace Event Notifications Queue**|Number of trace event notification instances waiting in the internal queue to be sent through Service Broker.|  
|**Transactions**|Number of transaction enlistments (local, DTC, bound all combined).|  
|**User Connections**|Counts the number of users currently connected to SQL Server.|
