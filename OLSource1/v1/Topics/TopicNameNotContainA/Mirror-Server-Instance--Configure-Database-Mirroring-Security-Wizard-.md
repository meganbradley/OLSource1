# Mirror Server Instance (Configure Database Mirroring Security Wizard)
Use this page to specify information about the server instance with the mirror database.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  The mirror server instance must be running the same edition of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)], either Standard or Enterprise, as the principal server instance. Also, we strongly recommend that they run on comparable systems that can handle identical workloads.  
  
 **To configure database mirroring by using SQL Server Management Studio**  
  
-   [Establish a Database Mirroring Session Using Windows Authentication (SQL Server Management Studio)](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Establish-a-Database-Mirroring-Session-Using-Windows-Authentication--SQL-Server-Management-Studio-.md)  
  
-   [Start the Configuring Database Mirroring Security Wizard (SQL Server Management Studio)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Start-the-Configuring-Database-Mirroring-Security-Wizard--SQL-Server-Management-Studio-.md)  
  
## Options  
 **Mirror server instance**  
 If a mirror server instance is already specified (on the **Mirroring** page of the **Database Properties** dialog box), that instance is displayed; for more information, see [Database Properties (Mirroring Page)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Database-Properties--Mirroring-Page-.md).  
  
 Otherwise, enter the name of the mirror server instance. Note that the mirror server instance cannot be the same as the principal server instance.  
  
 **Connect**  
 If a mirror server instance has not been specified, click **Connect**. This displays the **Connect to Server** dialog box in which you can specify the server instance and establish a connection.  
  
 If the instance has been specified, but the wizard lacks a connection with sufficient permission to check for the existence of the endpoint, click **Connect**. This displays the **Connect to Server** dialog box with the server instance pre-selected and unchangeable. Specify a domain account with sufficient permission, and connect to the server instance.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  When connecting to the server instance, the Configure Database Mirroring Security Wizard uses the credentials provided in the **Connect to Server** dialog box. These are different from the credentials of a mirroring session, which uses the credentials of the startup account where the server instance is running as a service.  
  
 **Listener Port**  
 The behavior of this option depends on whether the mirroring endpoint exists for this server instance, as follows:  
  
-   If a listener port does not exist for the server instance, port number 5022 is displayed in the **Port** text box. You can use any available port number, such as 7022.  
  
-   When the mirroring endpoint already exists, the port number from that endpoint is displayed. If you need to change the port, use an ALTER ENDPOINT command. For more information, see [ALTER ENDPOINT (Transact-SQL)](assetId:///70f35566-30cf-47c6-8394-dfe5d71629d3).  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  A port number is required.  
  
 **Endpoint name**  
 If the mirroring endpoint exists for this server instance, the endpoint name is displayed here. If the endpoint does not exist, you can specify the name of the endpoint.  
  
 **Encrypt data sent through this endpoint**  
 By default, encryption is enabled. When enabled, encryption is required (not merely supported) and uses the default values for all of the encryption options. For more information, see [CREATE ENDPOINT (Transact-SQL)](assetId:///6405e7ec-0b5b-4afd-9792-1bfa5a2491f6).  
  
 To disable encryption, clear the check box. To re-enable encryption, select the check box.
