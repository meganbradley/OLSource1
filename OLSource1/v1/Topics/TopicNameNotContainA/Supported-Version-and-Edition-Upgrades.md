# Supported Version and Edition Upgrades
You can upgrade from [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssKatmai_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssKilimanjaro_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL11_md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL14_md.md)]. This topic lists the supported upgrade paths from these [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] versions, and the supported edition upgrades for [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)].  
  
## Pre upgrade Checklist  
  
-   Before upgrading from one edition of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] to another, verify that the functionality you are currently using is supported in the edition to which you are moving.  
  
-   Before upgrading [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)], enable Windows Authentication for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent and verify the default configuration: that the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent service account is a member of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] sysadmin group.  
  
-   To upgrade to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)], you must be running a supported operating system. For more information, see [Hardware and Software Requirements for Installing SQL Server 2016](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Hardware-and-Software-Requirements-for-Installing-SQL-Server-2016.md).  
  
-   Upgrade will be blocked if there is a pending restart.  
  
-   Upgrade will be blocked if the Windows Installer service is not running.  
  
## Unsupported Scenarios  
  
-   Cross-version instances of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] are not supported. Version numbers of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] components must be the same in an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)].  
  
-   Cross-platform upgrade is not supported. You cannot upgrade a 32-bit instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] to native 64-bit using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Setup. However, you can back up or detach databases from a 32-bit instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)], and then restore or attach them to a new instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] (64-bit) if the databases are not published in replication. You must re-create any logins and other user objects in master, msdb, and model system databases.  
  
-   You cannot add new features during the upgrade of your existing instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)]. After you upgrade an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)], you can add features by using the [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] Setup. For more information, see [Add Features to an Instance of SQL Server 2016 (Setup)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Add-Features-to-an-Instance-of-SQL-Server-2016--Setup-.md).  
  
-   Failover Clusters are not supported in WOW mode.  
  
-   Upgrade from an Evaluation edition of a previous [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] version is not supported.  
  
## Upgrades from Earlier Versions to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)]  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Support for [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssVersion2005_md.md)] is described in more detail in the next section, '[!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] support for [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssVersion2005_md.md)]'.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] 32-bit editions can be upgraded to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] on the 32-bit subsystem (WOW64) of a 64-bit server.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] 64-bit versions can be upgraded to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] 64-bit server only.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  When you upgrade to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] from a prior version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Enterprise edition, choose between Enterprise Edition: Core-based Licensing and Enterprise Edition. These Enterprise editions differ only with respect to the licensing modes and the maximum number of cores supported. For more information, see [Compute Capacity Limits by Edition of SQL Server](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Compute-Capacity-Limits-by-Edition-of-SQL-Server.md).  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] supports upgrade from the following versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)]:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssKatmai_md.md)] SP3 or later  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssKilimanjaro_md.md)] SP2 or later  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL11_md.md)] SP1 or later  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL14_md.md)] or later  
  
 The table below lists the supported upgrade scenarios from earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)].

###  <a name="SupportFor2005"></a> [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] Support for [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssVersion2005_md.md)]  
 This section discusses [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] support for [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssVersion2005_md.md)]. In [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)], you will be able to do the following:  
  
-   Attach a [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssVersion2005_md.md)] database (mdf/ldf files) to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] instance of database engine.  
  
-   Restore a [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssVersion2005_md.md)] database to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] instance of database engine from a backup.  
  
-   Back up a [!INCLUDE[ssASversion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ssASversion2005_md.md)] cube and restoring on [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)].  
  
 When a [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssVersion2005_md.md)] database is upgraded to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)], the database compatibility level will be changed from 90 to 100. (In [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)], valid values for the database compatibility level are 100, 110, 120, and 130.) [ALTER DATABASE Compatibility Level (Transact-SQL)](assetId:///ca5fd220-d5ea-4182-8950-55d4101a86f6) discusses how the compatibility level change could affect [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] applications.  
  
 Any scenarios not specified in the list above are not supported, including but not limited to the following:  
  
-   Installing [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssVersion2005_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] on same computer (side by side).  
  
-   Using a [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssVersion2005_md.md)] instance as a member of the replication topology that involves a [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] instance.  
  
-   Configuring database mirroring between [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssVersion2005_md.md)] instances.  
  
-   Backing up the transaction log with log shipping between [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssVersion2005_md.md)] instances.  
  
-   Configuring linked servers between [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssVersion2005_md.md)] instances.  
  
-   Managing a [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssVersion2005_md.md)] instance from a [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] Management Studio.  
  
-   Attaching a [!INCLUDE[ssASversion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ssASversion2005_md.md)] cube in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] Management Studio.  
  
-   Connecting to [!INCLUDE[ssISversion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ssISversion2005_md.md)] from [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] Management Studio.  
  
-   Managing a [!INCLUDE[ssISversion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ssISversion2005_md.md)] service from [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] Management Studio.  
  
-   Support for [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssVersion2005_md.md)] third party custom Integration Services components, such as execute and upgrade.
