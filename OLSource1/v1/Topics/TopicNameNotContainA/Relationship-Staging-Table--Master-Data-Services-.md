# Relationship Staging Table (Master Data Services)
  Use the relationship staging table \(stg.name\_Relationship\) in the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Token\Other/ssMDSshort_md.md)] database to change the location of members in an explicit hierarchy, based on the relationship the members have to one another.  
  
##  <a name="TableColumns"></a> Table Columns
