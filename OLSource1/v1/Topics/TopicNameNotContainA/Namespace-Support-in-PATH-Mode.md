# Namespace Support in PATH Mode
Namespace support in the PATH mode is provided by using WITH NAMESPACES. For example, the following query demonstrates the WITH NAMESPACES syntax to declare a namespace ("a:") that can then be used in the subsequent SELECT statement:  
  
```  
WITH XMLNAMESPACES('a' as a)  
SELECT 1 as 'a:b'  
FOR XML PATH  
```  
  
## Examples  
 These samples illustrate the use of PATH mode in generating XML from a SELECT query. Many of these queries are specified against the bicycle manufacturing instructions XML documents that are stored in the Instructions column of the ProductModel table.
