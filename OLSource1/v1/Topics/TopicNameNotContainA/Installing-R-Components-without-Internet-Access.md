# Installing R Components without Internet Access
Setup of the R components used by [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] requires an Internet connection for access to files that are provided either on the Microsoft Download Center or another trusted site. However, you can install these components on a server without Internet access by making local copies as described in this topic.  
  
## Installation on Computers with No Internet Access  
 If you are performing an offline install, [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] cannot access the links for installing required R components. To avoid this problem, you can download a copy of the installers locally and complete setup as described here:  
  
1.  Pause the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] setup wizard without closing it.  
  
2.  [!INCLUDE[sssNoversion]()] setup should display a dialog box with links to the installers for the required components.  
  
     On opening the link, download begins immediately. By default installers are saved to the **Downloads** folder.  
  
    > [!TIP]  
    >  If a list of links does not appear, you can download the installers from these sites (RC2 and RC3 only).  
    >   
    >  **Microsoft R Open**

3.  Open the installation packages using the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] setup wizard.
