# SQL Server Profiler Templates and Permissions
[!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSqlProfiler_md.md)] shows how [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] resolves queries internally. This allows administrators to see exactly what [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/tsql_md.md)] statements or Multi-Dimensional Expressions are submitted to the server and how the server accesses the database or cube to return result sets.  
  
 Using [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSqlProfiler_md.md)], you can do the following:  
  
-   Create a trace that is based on a reusable template  
  
-   Watch the trace results as the trace runs  
  
-   Store the trace results in a table  
  
-   Start, stop, pause, and modify the trace results as necessary  
  
-   Replay the trace results  
  
 Use [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSqlProfiler_md.md)] to monitor only the events in which you are interested. If traces are becoming too large, you can filter them based on the information you want, so that only a subset of the event data is collected. Monitoring too many events adds overhead to the server and the monitoring process, and can cause the trace file or trace table to grow very large, especially when the monitoring process takes place over a long period of time.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Trace column values greater than 1 GB return an error and are truncated in the trace output.
