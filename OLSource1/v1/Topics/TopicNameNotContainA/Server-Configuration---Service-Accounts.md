# Server Configuration - Service Accounts
Use the Server Configuration page of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Installation Wizard to assign login accounts to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] services. The actual services configured on this page depend on the features you have selected to install.  
  
 Startup accounts used to start and run [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] can be  domain user accounts, local user accounts, managed service accounts, virtual accounts, or built-in system accounts.  
  
## Options  
 You can assign the same login account to all [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] services, or you can configure each service account individually. You can also specify whether services start automatically, are started manually, or are disabled. The default account is recommended for most installations.  
  
 On Windows 7 and [!INCLUDE[nextref_longhorn](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/nextref_longhorn_md.md)] R2 most accounts default to a virtual account.  
  
 If you configure services to use domain accounts, [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] recommends that you configure service accounts individually to provide least privileges for each service, where [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] services are granted the minimum permissions they need to complete their tasks. For more information including descriptions of the types of accounts, see [Configure Windows Service Accounts and Permissions](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Configure-Windows-Service-Accounts-and-Permissions.md).  
  
 **Configure [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] service accounts individually (recommended)**  
 Use the grid to provision each [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] service with a logon user name and password, and to set the startup type for the service. You can use built-in system accounts, a local account, local group, domain group, or domain user accounts for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] services.  
  
 Select any of the following services to customize its settings.

|[!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)]|For SharePoint integrated mode, you must specify a Windows domain user account. The account you specify is used for the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] service. The account you specify for the current instance must also be used for any additional [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] instances that you subsequently add to the same farm.|The default startup type is Automatic.|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)]|Service accounts are used to configure a report server database connection. Choose the built-in network service if you want to use default authentication settings. If you specify a domain user account, be sure to register a service principle name (SPN) for it if you are using Windows Authentication on the report server. For more information, see [Configure Windows Authentication on the Report Server](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Configure-Windows-Authentication-on-the-Report-Server.md).|The default startup type is Automatic.|
