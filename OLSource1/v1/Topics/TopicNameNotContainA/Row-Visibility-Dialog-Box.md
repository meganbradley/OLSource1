# Row Visibility Dialog Box
Use the **Row Visibility** dialog box to show or hide the selected row when the report is first run or to use another report item to toggle the visibility of the row.  
  
## Options  
 **When the report is initially run**  
 Select an option to indicate how the report item is initially displayed in the report.  
  
 **Show**  
 Select this option to show the report item.  
  
 **Hide**  
 Select this option to hide the report item.  
  
 **Show or hide based on an expression**  
 Select this option to vary the initial visibility using an expression.  
  
 Type an expression that evaluates to a **Boolean** value of **True** to hide the item and **False** to show the item. Click the Expression (**fx**) button to edit the expression.  
  
 **Display can be toggled by this report item**  
 Choose this option to display a toggle image that enables the user to show or hide this report item in an HTML report viewer.  
  
 Type or select the name of a text box in the report in which to display a toggle image; for example, Textbox1. The text box that you choose must be in the current or containing scope for this report item. For example, to toggle visibility of rows associated with a child group, select a text box in a row associated with the parent group. To toggle visibility of a chart, select a text box that is in the same containing scope as the chart; for example, the report body or a rectangle.
