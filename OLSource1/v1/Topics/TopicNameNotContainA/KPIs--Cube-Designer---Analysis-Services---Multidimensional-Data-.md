# KPIs (Cube Designer) (Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data)
  Use the **KPIs** tab in Cube Designer to view and edit Key Performance Indicators \(KPIs\) for the selected cube.  
  
## Form View and Browser View  
 The **KPIs** tab supports two different views when viewing or editing KPIs:  
  
-   Form view  
  
     This view displays an organized view of the KPIs contained by the cube and provides a form editor to view and edit a KPI, as well as displaying the metadata, functions, and tools available to the cube.  
  
-   Browser view  
  
     This view displays the results of the KPIs contained by the cube in a browser, with the capability to provide filter criteria when viewing KPI results.
