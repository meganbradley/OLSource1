# Choose Enhancement (Business Intelligence Wizard)
  Use the **Choose Enhancement** page to choose the business intelligence enhancement to add to your cube or dimension.  
  
## Options  
 **Available enhancements**  
 Select the business intelligence enhancement to be added. The following table lists the enhancements that are available.  
  
|Enhancement|Description|  
|-----------------|-----------------|  
|**Define time intelligence**|Add additional time views for a selected hierarchy. These include period\-to\-date views, rolling average views, and period\-to\-period views.<br /><br /> Note: This option is available only for cubes.|  
|**Define account intelligence**|Assign standard accounting classifications, such as income and expense, for members of an account attribute.<br /><br /> If the aggregation function for the measure is set to *ByAccount*, the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Token\Other/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssASnoversion_md.md)] instance uses the accounting classifications to aggregate a measure across the members of an account attribute over time.|  
|**Define dimension intelligence**|Use dimension intelligence to specify a standard business type for a dimension and to specify valid types for the dimension attributes. Client applications can use these type specifications when analyzing data.|  
|**Specify a unary operator**|Specify a unary operator to replace the default aggregation that is associated with members of a parent\-child hierarchy included in a cube.<br /><br /> Note: This option is available only for cubes.|  
|**Create a custom member formula**|Create a custom member formula to replace the default aggregation that is associated with a dimension member with a different operator.|  
|**Specify attribute ordering**|Specify how the members of a selected attribute are ordered. Members can be ordered by the name or key of a selected attribute, or by the name or key of an attribute related to the selected attribute. By default, members are ordered by the name of the selected attribute.|  
|**Enable dimension writeback**|Enable manual modification of the dimension structure. Updates to a write\-enabled dimension are recorded directly in the dimension table.|  
|**Define semiadditive behavior**|Manually define the aggregation method for individual measures or members of an account type attribute. If the cube contains an account dimension, you can use the **Define account intelligence** option to automatically set semi\-additive behavior based on the account type.<br /><br /> Note: This option is available only for cubes.|  
|**Define currency conversion**|Define rules for converting and analyzing multinational data in the cube. Conversion rules are applied in the cube using a Multidimensional Expressions \(MDX\) script generated by the Business Intelligence Wizard.<br /><br /> Note: This option is available only for cubes.|
