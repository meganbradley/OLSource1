# Create, Construct, and Query geometry Instances
  The planar spatial data type, **geometry**, represents data in a Euclidean \(flat\) coordinate system. This type is implemented as a common language runtime \(CLR\) data type in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)].  
  
 The **geometry** type is predefined and available in each database. You can create table columns of type **geometry** and operate on **geometry** data in the same manner as you would use other CLR types.  
  
 The **geometry** data type \(planar\) supported by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] conforms to the Open Geospatial Consortium \(OGC\) Simple Features for SQL Specification version 1.1.0.  
  
 For more information on OGC specifications, see the following:  
  
-   [OGC Specifications, Simple Feature Access Part 1 \- Common Architecture](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=93628)  
  
-   [OGC Specifications, Simple Feature Access Part 2 â€“ SQL Options](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=93629)  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] supports a subset of the existing GML 3.1 standard which is defined in the following schema: [http:\/\/schemas.microsoft.com\/sqlserver\/profiles\/gml\/SpatialGML.xsd](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=230959).

###  <a name="dimension"></a> Dimension  
 A nonempty **geometry** instance can be 0\-, 1\-, or 2\-dimensional. Zero\-dimensional **geometries**, such as **Point** and **MultiPoint**, have no length or area. One\-dimensional objects, such as **LineString, CircularString, CompoundCurve**, and **MultiLineString**, have length. Two\-dimensional instances, such as **Polygon**, **CurvePolygon**, and **MultiPolygon**, have area and length. Empty instances will report a dimension of \-1, and a **GeometryCollection** will report an area dependent on the types of its contents.

 For a **geometry** of the instance to be *simple*, it must meet both of these requirements:  
  
-   Each figure of the instance must not intersect itself, except at its endpoints.  
  
-   No two figures of the instance can intersect each other at a point that is not in both of their boundaries.

###  <a name="boundary"></a> Boundary, Interior, and Exterior  
 The *interior* of a **geometry** instance is the space occupied by the instance, and the *exterior* is the space not occupied it.  
  
 *Boundary* is defined by the OGC as follows:  
  
-   **Point** and **MultiPoint** instances do not have a boundary.  
  
-   **LineString** and **MultiLineString** boundaries are formed by the start points and end points, removing those that occur an even number of times.  
  
```  
DECLARE @g geometry;  
SET @g = geometry::Parse('MULTILINESTRING((0 1, 0 0, 1 0, 0 1), (1 1, 1 0))');  
SELECT @g.STBoundary().ToString();  
```  
  
 The boundary of a **Polygon** or **MultiPolygon** instance is the set of its rings.  
  
```  
DECLARE @g geometry;  
SET @g = geometry::Parse('POLYGON((0 0, 3 0, 3 3, 0 3, 0 0), (1 1, 1 2, 2 2, 2 1, 1 1))');

##  <a name="defaultsrid"></a> geometry Instances Default to Zero SRID  
 The default SRID for **geometry** instances in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] is 0. With **geometry** spatial data, the specific SRID of the spatial instance is not required to perform calculations; thus, instances can reside in undefined planar space. To indicate undefined planar space in the calculations of **geometry** data type methods, the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssDEnoversion_md.md)] uses SRID 0.  
  
##  <a name="examples"></a> Examples  
 The following two examples show how to add and query geometry data.  
  
-   The first example creates a table with an identity column and a `geometry` column `GeomCol1`. A third column renders the `geometry` column into its Open Geospatial Consortium \(OGC\) Well\-Known Text \(WKT\) representation, and uses the `STAsText()` method. Two rows are then inserted: one row contains a `LineString` instance of `geometry`, and one row contains a `Polygon` instance.  
  
    ```  
    IF OBJECT_ID ( 'dbo.SpatialTable', 'U' ) IS NOT NULL   
        DROP TABLE dbo.SpatialTable;  
    GO  
  
    CREATE TABLE SpatialTable   
        ( id int IDENTITY (1,1),  
        GeomCol1 geometry,   
        GeomCol2 AS GeomCol1.STAsText() );  
    GO  
  
    INSERT INTO SpatialTable (GeomCol1)  
    VALUES (geometry::STGeomFromText('LINESTRING (100 100, 20 180, 180 180)', 0));  
  
    INSERT INTO SpatialTable (GeomCol1)  
    VALUES (geometry::STGeomFromText('POLYGON ((0 0, 150 0, 150 150, 0 150, 0 0))', 0));  
    GO  
    ```  
  
-   The second example uses the `STIntersection()` method to return the points where the two previously inserted `geometry` instances intersect.  
  
    ```  
    DECLARE @geom1 geometry;  
    DECLARE @geom2 geometry;  
    DECLARE @result geometry;  
  
    SELECT @geom1 = GeomCol1 FROM SpatialTable WHERE id = 1;  
    SELECT @geom2 = GeomCol1 FROM SpatialTable WHERE id = 2;  
    SELECT @result = @geom1.STIntersection(@geom2);  
    SELECT @result.STAsText();  
    ```
