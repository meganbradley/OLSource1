# Validate Plan Guides After Upgrade
We recommend re-evaluating and testing plan guide definitions when you upgrade your application to a new release of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)]. Performance tuning requirements and plan guide matching behavior may change. Although an invalid plan guide will not cause a query to fail, the plan is compiled without using the plan guide and may not be the best choice. After upgrading a database to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)], we recommend that you perform the following tasks:  
  
-   Validate existing plan guides by using the [sys.fn_validate_plan_guide](assetId:///3af8b47a-936d-4411-91d1-d2d16dda5623) function.  
  
-   Use extended events to monitor for misguided plans for some period of time by using the [Plan Guide Unsuccessful](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Plan-Guide-Unsuccessful-Event-Class.md) event.
