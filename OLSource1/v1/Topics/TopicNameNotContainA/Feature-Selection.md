# Feature Selection
Use the check boxes on the **Feature Selection** page of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Installation wizard to select components for your [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] installation.  
  
## Installing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Features  
 On the **Feature Selection** page, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] features are separated into two main sections: **Instance Features** and **Shared Features**.  
  
 **Instance Features** refers to the components that are installed once for each instance so that you have multiple copies of them (one for each instance). Each instance can be a separate version that has a different patch level. When you install a patch, whether it is a service pack, a hotfix, or a cumulative update, it updates only the files for one instance on a given machine, plus the shared features if they have not already been updated.  
  
 **Shared Features** refers to features that are common across all instances on a given machine. Each of these shared features is designed to be backward compatible with supported [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] versions (service packs, cumulative updates, and hotfixes) that can install side by side.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  **[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Failover Clusters:** The [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] components are the only [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] features that support failover clustering. You can install other components, like [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)], on a failover cluster node, but they are not cluster-aware, and their services do not fail over if the failover cluster node goes offline. For more information, see [Always On Failover Cluster Instances (SQL Server)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Always-On-Failover-Cluster-Instances--SQL-Server-.md).  
  
### Instance Features  
 A description for each component group appears in the **Description** pane when you select it. You can select any combination of check boxes. To continue, you must make a selection.
