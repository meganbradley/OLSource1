# SSIS Package Explorer Tab
  Use the **Package Explorer** tab of [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../Token\Other/ssIS_md.md)] Designer to see a hierarchical view of all of the elements in a package: configurations, connections, event handlers, executable objects such as tasks and containers, log providers, precedence constraints, and variables. If a package contains a Data Flow task, the **Package Explorer** tab includes a node that contains a hierarchical view of the data flow components.  
  
 Right\-click a package element, and then click **Properties** to show the properties of the element in the **Properties** window, or click **Delete** to delete the element.
