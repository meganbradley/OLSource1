 To learn more about the WMI connection manager, see [WMI Connection Manager](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/WMI-Connection-Manager.md).  
  
## Options  
 **Name**  
 Provide a unique name for the connection manager.  
  
 **Description**  
 Describe the connection manager. As a best practice, describe the connection manager in terms of its purpose, to make packages self\-documenting and easier to maintain.

 Provide the name of the server to which you want to make the WMI connection.  
  
 **Namespace**  
 Specify the WMI namespace.  
  
 **Use Windows authentication**  
 Select to use Windows Authentication. If you use Windows Authentication, you do not need to provide a user name or password for the connection.  
  
 **User name**  
 If you do not use Windows Authentication, you must provide a user name for the connection.  
  
 **Password**  
 If you do not use Windows Authentication, you must provide the password for the connection.  
  
 **Test**  
 Test the connection manager settings.
