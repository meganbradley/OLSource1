# Data Mining Wizards
  [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Token\Other/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssASnoversion_md.md)] provides wizards for use in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)].  
  
 The following table describes the wizards that you can use to create data mining sources, views, and objects.  
  
|Topic|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[Data Source Wizard F1 Help &#40;Analysis Services&#41;](../Topic/Data%20Source%20Wizard%20F1%20Help%20\(Analysis%20Services\).md)|Use the Data Source Wizard to define a new data source.|  
|[Data Source View Wizard F1 Help &#40;Analysis Services&#41;](../Topic/Data%20Source%20View%20Wizard%20F1%20Help%20\(Analysis%20Services\).md)|Use the Data Source View Wizard to define a new data source view.|  
|[Data Mining Wizard F1 Help &#40;Analysis Services - Data Mining&#41;](../Topic/Data%20Mining%20Wizard%20F1%20Help%20\(Analysis%20Services%20-%20Data%20Mining\).md)|Use the Data Mining Wizard to define a new mining structure and associated mining models.|  
  
 In addition to the wizards, you can build, modify, and process data mining objects in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] by using the graphical design tools that are provided.
