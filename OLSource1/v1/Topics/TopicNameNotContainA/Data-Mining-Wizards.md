# Data Mining Wizards
[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] provides wizards for use in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)].  
  
 The following table describes the wizards that you can use to create data mining sources, views, and objects.  
  
|Topic|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[Data Source Wizard F1 Help (Analysis Services)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Data-Source-Wizard-F1-Help--Analysis-Services-.md)|Use the Data Source Wizard to define a new data source.|  
|[Data Source View Wizard F1 Help (Analysis Services)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Data-Source-View-Wizard-F1-Help--Analysis-Services-.md)|Use the Data Source View Wizard to define a new data source view.|  
|[Data Mining Wizard F1 Help (Analysis Services - Data Mining)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Data-Mining-Wizard-F1-Help--Analysis-Services---Data-Mining-.md)|Use the Data Mining Wizard to define a new mining structure and associated mining models.|  
  
 In addition to the wizards, you can build, modify, and process data mining objects in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] by using the graphical design tools that are provided.  
  
 For more information about editors that help you build data mining projects, see [Data Mining Designers and Dialog Boxes](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Data-Mining-Designers-and-Dialog-Boxes.md).  
  
 For information about wizards that help you design and work with multidimensional data, see [Analysis Services Wizards (Multidimensional Data)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Analysis-Services-Wizards--Multidimensional-Data-.md).
