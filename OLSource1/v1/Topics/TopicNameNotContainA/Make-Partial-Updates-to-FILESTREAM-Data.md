# Make Partial Updates to FILESTREAM Data
An application uses FSCTL_SQL_FILESTREAM_FETCH_OLD_CONTENT to make partial updates to FILESTREAM BLOB data. The [DeviceIoControl](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=105527) function passes this value and the handle that is returned from [OpenSqlFilestream](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Access-FILESTREAM-Data-with-OpenSqlFilestream.md) to the FILESTREAM driver. The driver then forces a server-side copy of the current FILESTREAM data into the file that is referenced by the handle. If the application issues the FSCTL_SQL_FILESTREAM_FETCH_OLD_CONTENT value after the handle has been written to, the last write operation persists and previous write operations that were made to the handle are lost.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  FILESTREAM relies on the [SMB protocol](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=112454) for remote access.  
  
## Example  
 The following example shows you how to use the `FSCTL_SQL_FILESTREAM_FETCH_OLD_CONTENT` value to perform a partial update of an inserted FILESTREAM BLOB.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This example requires the FILESTREAM-enabled database and table that are created in [Create a FILESTREAM-Enabled Database](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Create-a-FILESTREAM-Enabled-Database.md) and [Create a Table for Storing FILESTREAM Data](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Create-a-Table-for-Storing-FILESTREAM-Data.md).
