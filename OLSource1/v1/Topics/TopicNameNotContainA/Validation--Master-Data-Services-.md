# Validation (Master Data Services)
In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)], data is validated to ensure its accuracy. Some validation occurs automatically, and other validation is based on business rules that are created by administrators.  
  
## When Data Validation Occurs  
 Validation occurs at different times, and is displayed differently in the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)] web application.  
  
|Validation Type|Standards Determined by|When it Occurs|Displayed in the MasterData Manager web UI as|Displayed in the Add-in for Excel as|Is Data Saved to the MDS Repository?|
