# SQL Full-text Filter Daemon Launcher (Advanced)
  Beginning in [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../Token\Other/ssKatmai_md.md)], the SQL Full\-text Filter Daemon Launcher service is used by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] full\-text. This service must be running if you use full\-text search. For information about the filter daemon host processes, see "Full\-Text Search Architecture" in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Books Online.  
  
 No properties appear on the **Advanced** tab by default. If custom properties are defined, they also appear on this tab, with their values.
