# Controlling Page Breaks, Headings, Columns, and Rows (Report Builder and SSRS)
  A page break divides a report into separate pages for viewing and printing. Page breaks determine how the content is fitted to a report page for optimal viewing when you preview a report or export it to a different file format.  
  
 Adding page breaks also improves the performance of large reports when the are processed. A rendered page is displayed while the rest of the pages are rendered in the background. This allows you to begin viewing the initial pages of the report while waiting for additional pages to become available.  
  
 Page breaks can be added to report items such as a table, matrix, list, chart, gauge, or image. You can also add page breaks to groups in a table, matrix, or list. Page breaks can be added before, after, and between groups. Page breaks between groups are not added to the report by default.
