# Filters page, Chart Dialog Boxes (Report Builder and SSRS)
Click **Filters** in the:  
  
-   **Category Group Properties** dialog box to filter data points in a series that has been grouped by category.  
  
-   **Chart Properties** dialog box to define filtering options for the chart.  
  
-   **Series Group Properties** dialog box to limit the number of series in the selected group.  
  
## Options  
 **Add**  
 Click to add a new filter clause to the list.  
  
 **Delete**  
 Click to delete the selected filter clause from the list.  
  
 **Up arrow**  
 Click to move the selected filter up in the list.  
  
 **Down arrow**  
 Click to move the selected filter down in the list.  
  
 **Expression**  
 Type or choose the expression to which you want to apply a filter. Click the Expression (**fx**) button to edit the expression.  
  
 **Data type**  
 Choose the data type for **Value**. When possible, choose a data type that matches the data type for **Expression**.  
  
 The values in **Expression** and **Value** must evaluate to the same data type. For example, if **Expression** is set to a field that has the data type System.Int32 and **Value** is set to 7, from the drop-down list, choose **Integer**.  
  
 If the data type option you need is not in the drop-down list, write an expression to convert the value to the correct data type. For more information, see [Filter Equation Examples (Report Builder and SSRS)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Filter-Equation-Examples--Report-Builder-and-SSRS-.md).  
  
 **Operator**  
 Choose the operator to use to compare the expression and the value.  
  
 **Value**  
 Type the expression or value against which to evaluate the expression in **Expression**.
