# Maintenance Plan (Servers)
Use the **Servers** dialog box to select the servers where you want to run the maintenance plan.  
  
 A multiserver environment containing one master server and one or more target servers must be configured to create a multiserver maintenance plan. For multiserver maintenance plans, the local server should be configured as a master server. In multiserver environments, this dialog box displays the **(local)** master server and all corresponding target servers. One [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent job is created for the local server. It is enabled or disabled depending on whether you select the **(local)** server. If target servers are selected, a multiserver job is created and downloaded to each of the selected target servers. If no target servers are selected, the multiserver job is deleted.
