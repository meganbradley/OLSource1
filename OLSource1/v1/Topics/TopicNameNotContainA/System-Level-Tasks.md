# System-Level Tasks
  A system-level task is a collection of permissions that relate to operations that apply to the report server site as a whole. [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] also includes item-level tasks that apply to specific items. For more information, see [Item-Level Tasks](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Item-Level-Tasks.md). For more information about tasks and permissions in general, see [Tasks and Permissions](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Tasks-and-Permissions.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you are working with these tasks programmatically, you must use methods that support system-level tasks. For more information, see [ListTasks](assetId:///M:ReportService2010.ReportingService2010.ListTasks(System.String)) and [ListRoles](assetId:///M:ReportService2010.ReportingService2010.ListRoles(System.String,System.String)).
