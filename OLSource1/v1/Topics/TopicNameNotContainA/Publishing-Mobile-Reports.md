# Publishing Mobile Reports
## Publishing Steps   
  
To publish a mobile report to a server, open the desired mobile report in the designer, swipe up from the bottom of the screen (or right-click to activate the bottom menu) and click the publish button.  
  
If there are no server connections configured, one must first be configured. Enter the appropriate connection credentials and click Connect.  
  
If the mobile report has been edited since it was last saved, the first step in publishing a mobile report is to save it to the local folder. At this point, the title, filename, local group, culture, and fiscal start date can be modified. Make any desired changes and click Save.

The next step in publishing a mobile report is to configure the server settings. Server configuration options are the server to connect to, mobile report title on the server, hub, and server group. Make any desired changes and click Publish.

At this point the mobile report has been published and will be accessible from any mobile report viewer client.  
  
## Saving a Mobile Report Locally  
  
When publishing a mobile report it must first be saved locally as described above in Step 1. If you wish to save a mobile report locally without publishing this can be done at any point by swiping up or right clicking in the mobile report designer and selecting Save Locally.  
  
Mobile reports saved locally in your working directory will automatically appear on the main screen of [!INCLUDE[PRODUCT_NAME](../../Token\Other/PRODUCT_NAME.md)]. They may also be opened through the Windows file explorer by double-clicking on them.
