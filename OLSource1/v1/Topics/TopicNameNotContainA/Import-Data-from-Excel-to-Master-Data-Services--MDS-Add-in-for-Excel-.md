# Import Data from Excel to Master Data Services (MDS Add-in for Excel)
In the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssMDSXLS](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSXLS_md.md)], publish data to the MDS repository when you are finished working in Excel and want to save your changes so other users have access to them.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  -   When you publish changes, comments on MDS-managed cells are deleted.  
> -   A formula is not supported in an MDS-managed cell. A formula in an MDS-managed cell is handled as a text value.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have permission to access the **Explorer** functional area.  
  
-   The active worksheet must contain MDS-managed data and you must have made changes or additions to the MDS-managed data.  
  
-   If you are adding members, you do not have to specify a **Code** value if codes for the entity are being automatically generated. For more information, see [Automatic Code Creation (Master Data Services)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Automatic-Code-Creation--Master-Data-Services-.md).  
  
### To publish data to the MDS repository  
  
1.  In the **Publish and Validate** group, click **Publish**.  
  
2.  Optional. If the **Publish and Annotate** dialog box is displayed, choose to share the same annotation (comment) for all updates, or to annotate each change individually.  
  
3.  Optional. Select the **Do not show this dialog box again** check box. You can always show the dialog box in the future by choosing **Settings** and selecting the **Show Publish and Annotate dialog box when publishing** check box.  
  
4.  Click **Publish**.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you are adding new members (rows) to your worksheet and you cannot successfully publish them to the MDS repository, you may not have **Update** permission to all of the attributes in the worksheet. On the **Review** tab, in the **Changes** group, click **Unprotect Sheet** and try to publish again.
