# Processing and Storage Locations (Partition Wizard)
Use the **Processing and Storage Locations** page to specify the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] instance of the cube that owns the partition, as well as the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] instance that stores the data for the partition. You can define a partition as a remote partition by specifying either a remote [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] instance or a storage location other than the default storage location. For more information about remote partitions, see [Browse for Remote Folder Dialog Box (Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data)](assetId:///63f5d9f5-c6b6-4ceb-94fe-7b6c396d10bb).  
  
## Processing location Options  
 **Current server instance**  
 Makes the current [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] instance responsible for processing the partition.  
  
 **Remote Analysis Services data source**  
 Makes a remote [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] instance responsible for processing this partition.  
  
 From the dropdown list, select the data source representing the remote [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] instance that will be responsible for processing the partition.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  An error occurs if you select a data source in which the **Initial Catalog** connection string property is not set to a valid [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] database, or if the database specified in the **Initial Catalog** connection string property does not support remote partitions (in other words, the **MasterDatasourceID** property of the specified database is not set to a valid value).  
  
 **New**  
 Creates a new data source representing the remote [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] instance responsible for processing the partition.  
  
## Storage location Options  
 **Default server location**  
 Makes the data folder of the current [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] instance the storage location of the aggregation and indexing data for the partition.  
  
 **Specified folder**  
 Specifies the storage location of the aggregation and indexing data for the partition.  
  
 **...**  
 Displays the **Browse for Remote Folder** dialog box in which you can select a folder for **Specified folder**.
