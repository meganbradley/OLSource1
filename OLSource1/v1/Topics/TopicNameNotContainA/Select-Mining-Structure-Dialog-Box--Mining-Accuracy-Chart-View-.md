# Select Mining Structure Dialog Box (Mining Accuracy Chart View)
Use the **Select Mining Structure** dialog box to select a mining structure that contains the mining models for which you want to compare or test the accuracy.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The accuracy chart only supports comparing models that are based on the same mining structure.  
  
 The dialog box contains a tree view list of each mining structure that exists on the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] database. While you can expand each mining structure to explore the mining models that exist in the mining structure, you can use the dialog box only to select a mining structure.
