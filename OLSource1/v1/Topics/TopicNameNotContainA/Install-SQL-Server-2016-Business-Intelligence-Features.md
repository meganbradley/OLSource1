# Install SQL Server 2016 Business Intelligence Features
  SQL Server features that are part of the Microsoft Business Intelligence platform include [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssASnoversion_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssISnoversion_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Token\Other/ssMDSshort_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssRSnoversion_md.md)], and several client applications used for creating or working with analytical data. This section of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Setup documentation explains how to install these features.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssASnoversion_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] can be installed as standalone servers, in scale\-out configurations, or as shared service applications in a SharePoint farm. Installing the services in a farm enables BI features that are only available in SharePoint, including [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Token\Other/ssGemini_md.md)] for SharePoint and [!INCLUDE[ssCrescent](../../Token\Other/ssCrescent_md.md)], the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] ad hoc interactive report designer that runs on [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Token\Other/ssGemini_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssASnoversion_md.md)] tabular model databases.
