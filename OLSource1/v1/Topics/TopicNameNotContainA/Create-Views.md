# Create Views
You can create views in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/tsql_md.md)]. A view can be used for the following purposes:  
  
-   To focus, simplify, and customize the perception each user has of the database.  
  
-   As a security mechanism by allowing users to access data through the view, without granting the users permissions to directly access the underlying base tables.  
  
-   To provide a backward compatible interface to emulate a table whose schema has changed.
