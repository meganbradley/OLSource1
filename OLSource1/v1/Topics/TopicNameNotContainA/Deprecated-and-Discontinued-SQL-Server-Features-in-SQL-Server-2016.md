# Deprecated and Discontinued SQL Server Features in SQL Server 2016
  This topic describes the deprecated features that are still available in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Token\Other/ssCurrent_md.md)], and describes discontinued features that are no longer available after you upgrade to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Token\Other/ssCurrent_md.md)].  
  
 The deprecated features are scheduled to be removed in a future release of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)]. Deprecated features should not be used in new applications.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../Token\Other/ssSQL15_md.md)] is a 64\-bit application. 32\-bit installation is discontinued, though some elements run as 32\-bit components.  
  
-   For [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Token\Other/ssDE_md.md)] features, see [Deprecated Database Engine Features in SQL Server 2016](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/Deprecated-Database-Engine-Features-in-SQL-Server-2016.md).  
  
-   For [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Token\Other/ssDE_md.md)] replication features, see [Deprecated Features in SQL Server Replication](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/Deprecated-Features-in-SQL-Server-Replication.md).
