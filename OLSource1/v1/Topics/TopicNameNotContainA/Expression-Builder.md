# Expression Builder
Use the **Expression Builder** dialog box to create and edit a property expression or write the expression that sets the value of a variable using a graphical user interface that lists variables and provides a built-in reference to the functions, type casts, and operators that the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] expression language includes.  
  
 A property expression is an expression that is assigned to a property. When the expression is evaluated, the property is dynamically updated to use the evaluation result of the expression. Likewise, an expression that is used in a variable enables the variable value to be updated with the evaluation result of the expression.  
  
 There are many ways to use expressions:  
  
-   **Tasks** Update the To line that a Send Mail task uses by inserting an e-mail address that is stored in a variable; or update the Subject line by concatenating a string such as "Sales for: " and the current date returned by the GETDATE function.  
  
-   **Variables** Set the value of a variable to the current month by using an expression like `DATEPART("mm",GETDATE())`; or set the value of a string by concatenating the string literal and the current date by using the expression `"Today's date is " + (DT_WSTR,30)(GETDATE())`.  
  
-   **Connection Managers** Set the code page of a Flat File connection manager by using a variable that contains a different code page identifier; or specify the number of rows in the data file to skip by entering a positive integer like 3 in the expression.  
  
 To learn more about property expressions and writing expressions, see [Use Property Expressions in Packages](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Use-Property-Expressions-in-Packages.md) and [Integration Services (SSIS) Expressions](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Integration-Services--SSIS--Expressions.md).
