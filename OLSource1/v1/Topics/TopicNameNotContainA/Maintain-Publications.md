# Maintain Publications
  After you have created a publication, it might be necessary to add or drop articles, or change publication and article properties. Most changes are allowed after a publication is created, but in some cases, it is necessary to generate a new snapshot for a publication and\/or reinitialize subscriptions to the publication. For more information, see [Change Publication and Article Properties](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/Change-Publication-and-Article-Properties.md) and [Add Articles to and Drop Articles from Existing Publications](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/Add-Articles-to-and-Drop-Articles-from-Existing-Publications.md).
