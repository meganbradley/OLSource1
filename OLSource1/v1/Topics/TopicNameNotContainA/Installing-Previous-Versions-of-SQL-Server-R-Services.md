# Installing Previous Versions of SQL Server R Services
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  This page is provided only for backward compatibility, to support customers who are still using earlier releases of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)]. **We strongly recommend that you install [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] Release Candidate 2 or higher**.   For setup instructions, see [Set up SQL Server R Services (In-Database)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Set-up-SQL-Server-R-Services--In-Database-.md).  
>   
>  RC2 offers an easy, integrated setup experience for all R components., as well as improvements in performance and resource governance for R Services.  
  
 If you have one of the following older versions of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] and want to install [!INCLUDE[rsql_productname](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/rsql_productname_md.md)], use the instructions in this section.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] CTP 3.0 through CTP 3.3  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] Release Candidate 0 (RC0)  
  
 If you installed [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] before CTP 3.0, you must upgrade to at least CTP 3.0 and preferably to Release Candidate 1 (RC1).  
  
## I need to set up a server to deploy R solutions and support data scientists  
  
1.  Install **[!INCLUDE[rsql_extensions](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/rsql_extensions_md.md)]**, a new feature in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] that lets the R runtime be called from [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)].  
  
     You must install this feature on the server to operationalize predictive models. You do **not** need it on a client workstation.  
  
     Instructions: [Install Advanced Analytics Extensions](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Install-Advanced-Analytics-Extensions.md)  
  
     For other [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] requirements, see [Hardware and Software Requirements for Installing SQL Server 2016](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Hardware-and-Software-Requirements-for-Installing-SQL-Server-2016.md).  
  
2.  Download and install [!INCLUDE[rsql_rro-noversion](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/rsql_rro-noversion_md.md)]. This download contains a distribution of R provided under the General Public License (GPL) that includes the open source R runtime and several core package libraries.  
  
     This distribution is required for using R in [!INCLUDE[rsql_productname](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/rsql_productname_md.md)]. All client workstations that connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] instance must use the same version of [!INCLUDE[rsql_rro-noversion](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/rsql_rro-noversion_md.md)] to ensure compatibility with [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)].  
  
     Instructions and download links: [Install R Packages and Providers for SQL Server R Services](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Install-R-Packages-and-Providers-for-SQL-Server-R-Services.md)  
  
3.  Download and install [!INCLUDE[rsql_rre-noversion](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/rsql_rre-noversion_md.md)].  This download contains a set of enhanced R packages and providers that support high-performance analytics with [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] and with other data sources.  
  
     These tools are required for using [!INCLUDE[rsql_productname](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/rsql_productname_md.md)]. All client workstations that connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] instance must use the same version of [!INCLUDE[rsql_rre-noversion](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/rsql_rre-noversion_md.md)] to ensure compatibility with [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)].  
  
     Instructions and download links: [Install R Packages and Providers for SQL Server R Services](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Install-R-Packages-and-Providers-for-SQL-Server-R-Services.md)  
  
4.  Run the post-installation configuration steps.  
  
     Instructions: [Post-Installation Server Configuration (SQL Server R Services)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Post-Installation-Server-Configuration--SQL-Server-R-Services-.md)  
  
> [!TIP]  
>  Installing on an Azure virtual machine? Some additional steps are required because the [!INCLUDE[rsql_extensions](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/rsql_extensions_md.md)] feature is not enabled by default. For details, see [Upgrade and Installation FAQ (SQL Server R Services)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Upgrade-and-Installation-FAQ--SQL-Server-R-Services-.md).  
  
## I need to create a data science workstation  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If you intend to connect to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] to run R code in the context of the server, or use the RevoScaleR functions from a remote workstation, you must install the version of [!INCLUDE[rsql_rro-noversion](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/rsql_rro-noversion_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[rsql_rre-noversion](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/rsql_rre-noversion_md.md)] that is compatible with the build of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] that is installed on the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] computer.  
  
1.  Download and install**[!INCLUDE[rsql_rro-noversion](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/rsql_rro-noversion_md.md)]**, a distribution of R provided under the General Public License (GPL) that includes the open source R runtime and other libraries. This distribution is required for using R in [!INCLUDE[rsql_productname](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/rsql_productname_md.md)].  
  
     Instructions and download links: [Install R Packages and Providers for SQL Server R Services](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Install-R-Packages-and-Providers-for-SQL-Server-R-Services.md)  
  
2.  Download and install **[!INCLUDE[rsql_rre-noversion](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/rsql_rre-noversion_md.md)]**, a set of enhanced R packages and providers that support high-performance analytics with [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] and with other data sources. These tools are required for using [!INCLUDE[rsql_productname](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/rsql_productname_md.md)].  
  
     Instructions  and download links: [Install R Packages and Providers for SQL Server R Services](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Install-R-Packages-and-Providers-for-SQL-Server-R-Services.md)  
  
3.  If you will be using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] as a compute context,  talk to your database administrator about enabling the [!INCLUDE[rsql_extensions](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/rsql_extensions_md.md)] and providing you with access to the instance and any needed databases.  
  
     You can then develop R solutions on the workstation and send the R code to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] as described in [Tutorial: Data Exploration and Predictive Modeling (SQL Server R Services)](assetId:///65589d17-bd34-4baa-8ba1-998f60d0344f).  
  
> [!TIP]  
>  For examples of how you can develop R code and deploy it to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)], see [Tutorial: Data Exploration and Predictive Modeling (SQL Server R Services)](assetId:///65589d17-bd34-4baa-8ba1-998f60d0344f) or [Data Science Deep Dive: Overview (SQL Server R Services)](assetId:///4817b973-7ee4-4843-88ff-637665e44bd2).  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_Requirements"></a> Requirements  
 .NET 3.5 is a prerequisite for both client and server installation.   Note that .NET 3.5  is not installed as part of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] setup.  
  
#### To verify or install .NET 3.5  
  
1.  Open **Control Panel**, select **Programs** (or **Programs and Features**), and then click **Turn Windows features on or off**.  
  
2.  Expand the list item for **.NET Framework 3.5** (which includes .NET 2.0 and 3.0) and make sure that both of the WCF components are selected. [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/clickOK_md.md)]
