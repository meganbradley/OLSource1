# Change the Password of the Accounts Used by SQL Server (SQL Server Configuration Manager)
This topic describes how to change the password of the accounts used by the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] by using SQL Server Configuration Manager. The [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDEnoversion_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent run on a computer as a service using credentials that are initially provided during setup. If the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] is running under a domain account and the password for that account is changed, the password used by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] must be updated to the new password. If the password is not updated, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] may lose access to some domain resources and if [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] stops, the service will not restart until the password is updated.  
  
 To change [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Authentication passwords, see [Password Expired](assetId:///9831b194-9ad5-47b0-8009-59c7aef4319b).  
  
##  <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before You Begin  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Configuration Manager is the tool designed and authorized to change the settings of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] services. Changing a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] service by using the Windows Service Control Manager (**services.msc**) application does not always change all of the necessary settings and might prevent the service from functioning properly. However, in a clustered environment, after changing the password on the active node by using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Configuration Manager, you must change the password on the passive node by using the Service Control Manager.

 You must be an administrator of the computer to change the password used by a service.  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Configuration Manager  
  
#### To change the password used by the SQL Server (Database Engine) service  
  
1.  Click the **Start** button, point to **All Programs**, point to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrentUI](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrentUI_md.md)], point to **Configuration Tools**, and then click **SQL Server Configuration Manager**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Because [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Configuration Manager is a snap-in for the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] Management Console program and not a stand-alone program, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Configuration Manager does not appear as an application in newer versions of Windows.  
    >   
    >  -   **Windows 10**:  
    >          To open [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Configuration Manager, on the **Start Page**, type SQLServerManager13.msc (for [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL15_md.md)]). For previous versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] replace 13 with a smaller number. Clicking SQLServerManager13.msc opens the Configuration Manager. To pin the Configuration Manager to the Start Page or Task Bar, right-click SQLServerManager13.msc, and then click **Open file location**. In the Windows File Explorer, right-click SQLServerManager13.msc, and then click **Pin to Start** or **Pin to taskbar**.  
    > -   **Windows 8**:  
    >          To open [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Configuration Manager, in the **Search** charm, under **Apps**, type **SQLServerManager<version\>.msc** such as **SQLServerManager13.msc**, and then press **Enter**.  
  
2.  In SQL Server Configuration Manager, click **SQL Server Services**.  
  
3.  In the details pane, right-click **SQL Server (**<instancename\>**)**, and then click **Properties**.  
  
4.  In the **SQL Server (**<instancename\>**) Properties** dialog box, on the Log On tab, for the account listed in the **Account Name** box, type the new password in the **Password** and **Confirm Password** boxes, and then click **OK**.  
  
     The password takes effect immediately, without restarting [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)].  
  
#### To change the password used by the SQL Server Agent service  
  
1.  Click the **Start** button, point to **All Programs**, point to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrentUI](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrentUI_md.md)], point to **Configuration Tools**, and then click **SQL Server Configuration Manager**.  
  
2.  In SQL Server Configuration Manager, click **SQL Server Services**.  
  
3.  In the details pane, right-click **SQL Server Agent (**<instancename\>**)**, and then click **Properties**.  
  
4.  In the **SQL Server Agent (**<instancename\>**) Properties** dialog box, on the Log On tab, for the account listed in the **Account Name** box, type the new password in the **Password** and **Confirm Password** boxes, and then click **OK**.  
  
     On a stand-alone instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)], the password takes effect immediately, without restarting [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)]. On a clustered instance, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] might take the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] resource offline, and require a restart.
