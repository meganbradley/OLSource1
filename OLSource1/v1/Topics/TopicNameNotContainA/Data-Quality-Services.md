# Data Quality Services
[!INCLUDE[ssDQSnoversionLong](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ssDQSnoversionLong_md.md)] (DQS) is a knowledge-driven data quality product. DQS enables you to build a knowledge base and use it to perform a variety of critical data quality tasks, including correction, enrichment, standardization, and de-duplication of your data. DQS enables you to perform data cleansing by using cloud-based reference data services provided by reference data providers. DQS also provides you with profiling that is integrated into its data-quality tasks, enabling you to analyze the integrity of your data.  
  
 DQS consists of [!INCLUDE[ssDQSServer](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDQSServer_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssDQSClient](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDQSClient_md.md)], both of which are installed as part of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[ssDQSServer](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDQSServer_md.md)] is a SQL Server instance feature that consists of three SQL Server catalogs with data-quality functionality and storage. [!INCLUDE[ssDQSClient](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDQSClient_md.md)] is a SQL Server shared feature that business users, information workers, and IT professionals can use to perform computer-assisted data quality analyses and manage their data quality interactively. You can also perform data quality processes by using the [!INCLUDE[ssDQSCleansingLong](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ssDQSCleansingLong_md.md)] and Master Data Services (MDS) data quality functionality, both of which are based on DQS.  
  
 For information about installing DQS, see [Install Data Quality Services](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Install-Data-Quality-Services.md). If you want to upgrade your existing version of DQS to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)], see [Upgrade Data Quality Services](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Upgrade-Data-Quality-Services.md).
