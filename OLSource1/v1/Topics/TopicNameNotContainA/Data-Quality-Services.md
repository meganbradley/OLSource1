# Data Quality Services
  [!INCLUDE[ssDQSnoversionLong](../../Token\Other/ssDQSnoversionLong_md.md)] \(DQS\) is a knowledge\-driven data quality product. DQS enables you to build a knowledge base and use it to perform a variety of critical data quality tasks, including correction, enrichment, standardization, and de\-duplication of your data. DQS enables you to perform data cleansing by using cloud\-based reference data services provided by reference data providers. DQS also provides you with profiling that is integrated into its data\-quality tasks, enabling you to analyze the integrity of your data.  
  
 DQS consists of [!INCLUDE[ssDQSServer](../../Token\Other/ssDQSServer_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssDQSClient](../../Token\Other/ssDQSClient_md.md)], both of which are installed as part of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Token\Other/ssCurrent_md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[ssDQSServer](../../Token\Other/ssDQSServer_md.md)] is a SQL Server instance feature that consists of three SQL Server catalogs with data\-quality functionality and storage. [!INCLUDE[ssDQSClient](../../Token\Other/ssDQSClient_md.md)] is a SQL Server shared feature that business users, information workers, and IT professionals can use to perform computer\-assisted data quality analyses and manage their data quality interactively. You can also perform data quality processes by using the [!INCLUDE[ssDQSCleansingLong](../../Token\Other/ssDQSCleansingLong_md.md)] and Master Data Services \(MDS\) data quality functionality, both of which are based on DQS.  
  
 For information about installing DQS, see [Install Data Quality Services](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/Install-Data-Quality-Services.md). If you want to upgrade your existing version of DQS to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Token\Other/ssCurrent_md.md)], see [Upgrade Data Quality Services](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/Upgrade-Data-Quality-Services.md).
