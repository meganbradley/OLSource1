# Monitoring and Troubleshooting Merge for Data and Delta File Pairs
In-Memory OLTP uses a merge policy to merge adjacent data and delta file pairs automatically. You cannot disable merge activity.  
  
 You can monitor data and delta file pairs, as follows:  
  
-   Compare the size of in-memory storage to overall size of storage. If the storage is dis-proportionately large, then it is likely that merge is not getting triggered. For information  
  
-   Look at the used space in data and delta files using [sys.dm_db_xtp_checkpoint_files (Transact-SQL)](assetId:///ac8e6333-7a9f-478a-b446-5602283e81c9) to see if merge is not getting triggered when it should.
