The **Distributor to Subscriber History** tab displays detailed information on the Distribution Agent, including status, history, informational messages, and any error messages.  
  
## Options  
 Select which Distribution Agent sessions to view from the **View** menu, and then select a specific session in the grid labeled **Sessions of the Distribution Agent**. Detailed information on this session is displayed in the grid labeled **Actions in the selected session**. If the selected session ended in an error, the text area labeled **Error details or message of the selected session** is also displayed.  
  
 **View**  
 Select which Distribution Agent sessions to view. The Distribution Agent typically runs continuously, therefore there might be only one session to view.

 **Error Message**  
 If a session ended in an error, this field displays the last error message logged by the Distribution Agent. If a session did not end in an error, this field is blank.  
  
 **Action Message**  
 All informational messages and error messages that the Distribution Agent has logged during the selected session.
