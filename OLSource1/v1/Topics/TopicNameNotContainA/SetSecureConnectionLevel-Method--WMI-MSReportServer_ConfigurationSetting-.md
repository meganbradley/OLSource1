# SetSecureConnectionLevel Method (WMI MSReportServer_ConfigurationSetting)
  Sets the secure connection level of the report server.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```vb#  
Public Sub SetSecureConnectionLevel(Level as Integer, _  
    ByRef HRESULT as Int32)  
```  
  
```c#  
public void SetSecureConnectionLevel(Int32 Level,   
    out Int32 HRESULT);  
```  
  
## Parameters  
 *Level*  
 An integer value representing a secure connection level.  
  
 *HRESULT*  
 \[out\] Value indicating whether the call succeeded or failed.  
  
## Return Value  
 Returns an *HRESULT* indicating success or failure of the method call. A value of 0 indicates that the method call was successful. A non\-zero value indicates that an error has occurred.  
  
## Remarks  
 When called, the report server SecureConnectionLevel property is set to the value specified. A value of 0 indicates that SSL is turned off. A value greater than or equal to 1 indicates that SSL is turned on.  
  
-   When the value is set, the SecureConnectionLevel element in the report server configuration file is changed, and the **URLRoot** element in the configuration file is set to use "https:\/\/" if the specified *Level* is greater than or equal to 1, or "http:\/\/" if the specified *Level* is 0.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../../Token\Other/ssKilimanjaro_md.md)],Â SecureConnectionLevel is made an on\/off switch, default value is 0. For any value greater than or equal to 1 passed through SetSecureConnectionLevel method API, SSL is considered on and the configuration property SecureConnectionLevel is set accordingly in the rsreportserver.config file. Values of 2 and 3 are still allowed for backward compatibility.
