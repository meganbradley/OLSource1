# SQL Server Profiler F1 Help
Microsoft [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSqlProfiler_md.md)] is a tool that captures [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] events from a server. The events are saved in a trace file that can later be analyzed or used to replay a specific series of steps when trying to diagnose a problem.  
  
 The following section contains the context-sensitive help topics for [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSqlProfiler_md.md)]. These topics are available from the user interface by pressing the F1 key or by clicking **Help** in dialog boxes.
