# R Server (Standalone)
  **Microsoft R Server \(Standalone\)** is  part of the enterprise\-class analytics platform provided by Microsoft R Services.  
  
 It extends R by providing support, scalability, and security. [!INCLUDE[rsql_platform](../../Token\Other/rsql_platform_md.md)] also addresses the in\-memory limitations of open source R by adding parallel and chunked processing of data, enabling users to analyze data at enterprise scale, and use data much bigger than can fit in memory.  
  
  
## Getting Started with Microsoft R Server  
  
 For more information about how to set up a Windows server for supporting R applications,  see [Create a Standalone R Server](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/Create-a-Standalone-R-Server.md).  
  
For samples, tutorials, and more information about uses for a standalone R server, see [Microsoft R Server (MSDN)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/microsoft-r/index).
