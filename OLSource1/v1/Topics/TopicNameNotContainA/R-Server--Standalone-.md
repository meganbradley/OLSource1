# R Server (Standalone)
**Microsoft R Server (Standalone)** is  part of the enterprise-class analytics platform provided by Microsoft R Services.  
  
 It extends R by providing support, scalability, and security. [!INCLUDE[rsql_platform](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/rsql_platform_md.md)] also addresses the in-memory limitations of open source R by adding parallel and chunked processing of data, enabling users to analyze data at enterprise scale, and use data much bigger than can fit in memory.  
  
 For more information, see [Microsoft R Server (MSDN)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/microsoft-r/).  
  
## Getting Started with Microsoft R Server  
 If you have installed [!INCLUDE[rsql_productname](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/rsql_productname_md.md)], you can install **R Server (Standalone)** on a client workstation, to get the components needed to connect to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] and build high-performance R solutions.  
  
 For more information about how to set up a data science client for use with [!INCLUDE[rsql_productname](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/rsql_productname_md.md)], see [Create a Standalone R Server](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Create-a-Standalone-R-Server.md).  
  
 After you have configured the computer, you can connect to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] and use it as a remote compute context. For examples, see:
