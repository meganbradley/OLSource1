# Manage the Integration Services Service
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  This topic discusses the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] service, a Windows service for managing [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] packages. [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL11_md.md)] supports the service for backward compatibility with earlier releases of [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)]. Starting in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL11_md.md)], you can manage objects such as packages on the Integration Services server.  
  
 When you install the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] component of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)], the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] service is also installed. By default, the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] service is started and the startup type of the service is set to automatic. However, you must also install [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] to use the service to manage stored and running [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] packages.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You cannot connect to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssVersion2005_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] service from the [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssKatmai_md.md)] version of [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudio_md.md)]. That is, in the **Connect to Server** dialog box, you cannot enter the name of a server on which only the [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssVersion2005_md.md)] version of the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] service is running. However, you can edit the configuration file for the service and thereby manage packages that are stored in an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssVersion2005_md.md)] from the [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssKatmai_md.md)] version of [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudio_md.md)]. For more information, see [Configuring the Integration Services Service (SSIS Service)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Configuring-the-Integration-Services-Service--SSIS-Service-.md).  
  
 You can only install a single instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] service on a computer. The service is not specific to a particular instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)]. You connect to the service by using the name of the computer on which it is running.  
  
 You can manage the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] service by using one of the following Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-ins: SQL Server Configuration Manager or Services. Before you can manage packages in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)], you must make sure that the service is started.  
  
 By default, the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] service is configured to manage packages in the msdb database of the instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)] that is installed at the same time as [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)]. If an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)] is not installed at the same time, the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] service is configured to manage packages in the msdb database of the local, default instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)]. To manage packages that are stored in a named or remote instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)], or in multiple instances of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)], you have to modify the configuration file for the service. For more information, see [Configuring the Integration Services Service (SSIS Service)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Configuring-the-Integration-Services-Service--SSIS-Service-.md).  
  
 By default, the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] service is configured to stop running packages when the service is stopped. However, the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] service does not wait for packages to stop and some packages may continue running after the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] service is stopped.  
  
 If the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] service is stopped, you can continue to run packages using the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Import and Export Wizard, the [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssIS_md.md)] Designer, the Execute Package Utility, and the **dtexec** command prompt utility (dtexec.exe). However, you cannot monitor the running packages.  
  
 By default, the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] service runs in the context of the NETWORK SERVICE account.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] service writes to the Windows event log. You can view service events in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)]. You can also view service events by using the Windows Event Viewer.
