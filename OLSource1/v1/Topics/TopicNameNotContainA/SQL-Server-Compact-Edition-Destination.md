# SQL Server Compact Edition Destination
The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Compact destination writes data to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Compact databases.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  On a 64-bit computer, you must run packages that connect to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Compact data sources in 32-bit mode. The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Compact provider that [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] uses to connect to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Compact data sources is available only in a 32-bit version.  
  
 You configure the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Compact destination by specifying the name of the table into which the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Compact destination inserts the data. The custom property **TableName** of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Compact destination contains the table name.  
  
 This destination uses an [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Compact connection manager to connect to a data source, and the connection manager specifies the OLE DB provider to use. For more information, see [SQL Server Compact Edition Connection Manager](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/SQL-Server-Compact-Edition-Connection-Manager.md).  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Compact destination includes the **TableName** custom property, which can be updated by a property expression when the package is loaded. For more information, see [Integration Services (SSIS) Expressions](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Integration-Services--SSIS--Expressions.md), [Use Property Expressions in Packages](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Use-Property-Expressions-in-Packages.md), and [SQL Server Compact Edition Destination Custom Properties](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/SQL-Server-Compact-Edition-Destination-Custom-Properties.md).  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Compact destination has one input and does not support an error output.  
  
## Configuration of the SQL Server Compact Edition Destination  
 You can set properties through [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssIS_md.md)] Designer or programmatically.  
  
 The **Advanced Editor** dialog box reflects the properties that can be set programmatically. For more information about the properties that you can set in the **Advanced Editor** dialog box or programmatically, click one of the following topics:  
  
-   [Common Properties](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Common-Properties.md)
