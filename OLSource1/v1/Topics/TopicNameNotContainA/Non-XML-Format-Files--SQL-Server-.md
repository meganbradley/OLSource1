# Non-XML Format Files (SQL Server)
In [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)], two types of format files are supported for bulk exporting and importing: *non-XML format files* and *XML format files*.

##  <a name="Benefits"></a> Benefits of Non-XML Format Files  
  
-   You can create a non-XML format file automatically by specifying the **format** option in a **bcp** command.  
  
-   When you specify an existing format file in a **bcp** command, the command uses the values that are recorded in the format file and does not prompt you for the file storage type, prefix length, field length, or field terminator.  
  
-   You can create a format file for a particular data type such as character data or native data.  
  
     You can create a non-XML format file that contains interactively specified attributes for each data field. For more information, see [Specify Data Formats for Compatibility when Using bcp (SQL Server)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Specify-Data-Formats-for-Compatibility-when-Using-bcp--SQL-Server-.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  XML format files offer several advantages over non-XML format files. For more information, see [XML Format Files (SQL Server)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/XML-Format-Files--SQL-Server-.md).  
  
##  <a name="Structure"></a> Structure of Non-XML Format Files  
 A non-XML format file is a text file that has a specific structure. The non-XML format file contains information about the file storage type, prefix length, field length, and field terminator of every table column.  
  
 The following illustration illustrates the format-file fields for a sample non-XML format file.  
  
 ![Identifies the fields of a non&#45;XML format file](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/media/myDepart_fmt_ident_c.gif "myDepart_fmt_ident_c")  
  
 The **Version** and **Number of columns** fields occur one time only. Their meanings are describes in the following table.  
  
|Format-file field|Description|  
|------------------------|-----------------|  
|Version|Version number of the **bcp** utility:<br /><br /> 9.0 = [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssVersion2005_md.md)]<br /><br /> 10.0 = [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssKatmai_md.md)]<br /><br /> 11.0 = [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL11_md.md)]<br /><br /> 12.0 = [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL14_md.md)]<br /><br /> The version number is recognized only by **bcp**, not by [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/tsql_md.md)].<br /><br /> <br /><br /> Note: The version of the **bcp** utility (Bcp.exe) used to read a format file must be the same as, or a later version than was used to create the format file. For example, [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL11_md.md)]**bcp** can read a version 10.0 format file, which is generated by [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssKatmai_md.md)]**bcp**, but [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssKatmai_md.md)]**bcp** cannot read a version 12.0 format file, which is generated by [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSQL14_md.md)]**bcp**.|  
|Number of columns|Number of fields in the data file. This number must be the same in all rows.|  
  
 The other format-file fields describe the data fields that are to be bulk imported or exported. Each data field requires a separate row in the format file. Every format-file row contains values for the format-file fields that are described in the following table.  
  
|Format-file field|Description|  
|------------------------|-----------------|  
|**Host file field order**|A number that indicates the position of each field in the data file. The first field in the row is 1, and so on.|  
|**Host file data type**|Indicates the data type that is stored in a given field of the data file. With ASCII data files, use SQLCHAR; for native format data files, use default data types. For more information, see [Specify File Storage Type by Using bcp (SQL Server)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Specify-File-Storage-Type-by-Using-bcp--SQL-Server-.md).|  
|**Prefix length**|Number of length prefix characters for the field. Valid prefix lengths are 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8. To avoid specifying the length prefix, set this to 0. A length prefix must be specified if the field contains NULL data values. For more information, see [Specify Prefix Length in Data Files by Using bcp (SQL Server)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Specify-Prefix-Length-in-Data-Files-by-Using-bcp--SQL-Server-.md).|  
|**Host file data length**|Maximum length, in bytes, of the data type stored in the particular field of the data file.<br /><br /> If you are creating a non-XML format file for a delimited text file, you can specify 0 for the host file data length of every data field. When a delimited text file having a prefix length of 0 and a terminator is imported, the field-length value is ignored, because the storage space used by the field equals the length of the data plus the terminator.<br /><br /> For more information, see [Specify Field Length by Using bcp (SQL Server)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Specify-Field-Length-by-Using-bcp--SQL-Server-.md).|  
|**Terminator**|Delimiter to separate the fields in a data file. Common terminators are comma (,), tab (\t), and end of line (\r\n). For more information, see [Specify Field and Row Terminators (SQL Server)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Specify-Field-and-Row-Terminators--SQL-Server-.md).|  
|**Server column order**|Order in which columns appear in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] table. For example, if the fourth field in the data file maps to the sixth column in a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] table, the server column order for the fourth field is 6.<br /><br /> To prevent a column in the table from receiving any data from the data file, set the server column order value to 0.|  
|**Server column name**|Name of the column copied from the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] table. The actual name of the field is not required, but the field in the format file must not be blank.|  
|**Column collation**|The collation used to store character and Unicode data in the data file.|  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You can modify a format file to let you bulk import from a data file in which the number or order of the fields are different from the number or order of table columns. For more information, see the [Related Tasks](#RelatedTasks) list, later in this topic.  
  
##  <a name="Examples"></a> Example of a Non-XML Format File  
 The following example shows a previously created non-XML format file (`myDepartmentIdentical-f-c.fmt`). This file describes a character-data field for every column in the `HumanResources.Department` table in the `AdventureWorks2012` sample database.  
  
 The generated format file, `myDepartmentIdentical-f-c.fmt`, contains the following information:  
  
```  
12.0  
4  
1       SQLCHAR       0       7       "\t"     1     DepartmentID     ""  
2       SQLCHAR       0       100     "\t"     2     Name             SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS  
3       SQLCHAR       0       100     "\t"     3     GroupName        SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS  
4       SQLCHAR       0       24      "\r\n"   4     ModifiedDate     ""  
```
