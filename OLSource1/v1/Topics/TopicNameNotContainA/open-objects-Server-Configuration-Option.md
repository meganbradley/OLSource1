# open objects Server Configuration Option
This option is still present in **sp_configure**, although its functionality has been disabled in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)]. (The setting has no effect.) In [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)], the number of open database objects is managed dynamically and is limited only by the available memory. The **open objects** option available in **sp_configure** for backward compatibility with existing scripts.
