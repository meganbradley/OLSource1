# Filter Data before Exporting (MDS Add-in for Excel)
In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssMDSXLS](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSXLS_md.md)], filter data when you want to limit the size or scope of data that you are exporting to Excel.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have permission to access the **Explorer** functional area.  
  
### To filter data before exporting  
  
1.  Open Excel and on the **Master Data** tab, connect to an MDS repository. For more information, see [Connect to an MDS Repository (MDS Add-in for Excel)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Connect-to-an-MDS-Repository--MDS-Add-in-for-Excel-.md).  
  
2.  In the **Master Data Explorer** pane, select a model and version. The list of entities is populated.  
  
    -   If the **Master Data Explorer** pane is not visible, in the **Connect and Load** group, click **Show Explorer**.  
  
    -   If the **Master Data Explorer** pane is disabled, it is because the existing sheet already contains MDS-managed data. To enable the pane, open a new worksheet.  
  
3.  In the **Master Data Explorer** pane, in the list of entities, click the entity you want to filter.  
  
4.  On the ribbon, in the **Connect and Load** group, click **Filter**.  
  
5.  Complete the **Filter** dialog box by selecting the attributes (columns) to display, setting the order of the columns, and if needed, filtering the data so fewer rows are returned. View the **Summary** pane for how much data will be returned. For more information, see [Filter Dialog Box (MDS Add-in for Excel)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Filter-Dialog-Box--MDS-Add-in-for-Excel-.md).  
  
6.  Click **Load Data**. The sheet is populated with MDS-managed data.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  -   Only the first one million members are loaded into Excel.  
    > -   In columns that are constrained lists (domain-based attributes), by default only the first 25000 values are loaded.
