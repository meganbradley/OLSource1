# Use the Distributed Replay Utility to Prepare for Upgrades
  The [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Token\Other/msCoName_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Distributed Replay Utility can use multiple computers to replay trace data, simulating a mission\-critical workload. By performing a replay on a test server before and after a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] upgrade, you can measure performance differences and look for any incompatibilities your application may have with the upgrade. For more information, see [SQL Server Distributed Replay](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/SQL-Server-Distributed-Replay.md).
