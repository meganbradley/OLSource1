In Report Designer in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)], the Report Data pane displays a hierarchical view of data objects that you can use in a report, including data sources, datasets, fields, parameters, and images. Data sources in this view can be embedded or references to shared data sources that are displayed in Solution Explorer.
