# Breaking Changes in SQL Server Reporting Services in SQL Server 2016
  This topic describes breaking changes in [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssRSnoversion_md.md)]. These changes might break applications, scripts, or functionalities that are based on earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)]. You might encounter these issues when you upgrade, or in custom scripts or reports.  
  
  ## Security Extensions
  
  Custom security extensions need some modification to work with the new [!INCLUDE[ssRSWebPortal](../../Token\Other/ssRSWebPortal.md)].
  
  ## WMI Provider
  
  The [!INCLUDE[ssRSWebPortal](../../Token\Other/ssRSWebPortal.md)] application name changes from "ReportManager" to "ReportServerWebApp".
