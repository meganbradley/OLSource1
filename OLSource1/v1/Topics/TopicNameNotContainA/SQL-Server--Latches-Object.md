# SQL Server, Latches Object
The **SQLServer:Latches** object in Microsoft [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] provides counters to monitor internal [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] resource locks called latches. Monitoring the latches to determine user activity and resource usage can help you to identify performance bottlenecks.  
  
 This table describes the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] **Latches** counters.  
  
|SQL Server Latches counters|Description|  
|---------------------------------|-----------------|  
|**Average Latch Wait Time (ms)**|Average latch wait time (in milliseconds) for latch requests that had to wait.|  
|**Latch Waits/sec**|Number of latch requests that could not be granted immediately.|  
|**Number of SuperLatches**|Number of latches that are currently SuperLatches.|  
|**SuperLatch Demotions/sec**|Number of SuperLatches that have been demoted to regular latches in the last second.|  
|**SuperLatch Promotions/sec**|Number of latches that have been promoted to SuperLatches in the last second.|  
|**Total Latch Wait Time (ms)**|Total latch wait time (in milliseconds) for latch requests in the last second.|
