# Match Similar Data (MDS Add-in for Excel)
In the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssMDSXLS](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSXLS_md.md)], use Data Quality Services (DQS) functionality to find similarities in your data.  
  
 To perform this procedure, you can:  
  
-   Use the default Data Quality Services knowledge base, or  
  
-   Create your own custom DQS knowledge base and matching policy. For more information, see [Create a Matching Policy](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Create-a-Matching-Policy.md).  
  
## Prerequisites  
  
-   You must have a worksheet that contains MDS-managed data. For more information, see [Export Data to Excel from Master Data Services](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Export-Data-to-Excel-from-Master-Data-Services.md).  
  
-   Optional. You can combine other data with the MDS-managed data before checking for similarities. For more information, see [Combine Data (MDS Add-in for Excel)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Combine-Data--MDS-Add-in-for-Excel-.md).  
  
### To find similarities by using the default knowledge base  
  
1.  From the worksheet that contains MDS-managed data, in the **Data Quality** group, click **Match Data**.  
  
2.  In the **Match Data** dialog box, from the **DQS Knowledge Base** list, select **DQS Data (default)**.  
  
3.  For each column that contains data you want to match, add a row in the dialog box. For information about the fields in this dialog box, see [How to Set Matching Rule Parameters](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Create-a-Matching-Policy.md#MatchingRules).  
  
4.  When the total of all weight values equals 100 percent, click **OK**.  
  
### To find similarities by using a custom knowledge base  
  
1.  From the worksheet that contains MDS-managed data, in the **Data Quality** group, click **Match Data**.  
  
2.  From the **DQS Knowledge Base** list, select the name of your custom knowledge base.  
  
3.  For each column in the worksheet, select a DQS domain.  
  
4.  When all DQS domains are mapped to columns in the worksheet, click **OK**.  
  
## Next Steps  
  
-   View additional information to determine which data is similar. For more information, see [Data Quality Matching Columns (MDS Add-in for Excel)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Data-Quality-Matching-Columns--MDS-Add-in-for-Excel-.md).
