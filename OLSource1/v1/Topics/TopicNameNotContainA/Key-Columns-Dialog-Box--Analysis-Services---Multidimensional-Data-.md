Use the **Key Columns** dialog box to change the **KeyColumns** property of an attribute. For more information, see [Modify the KeyColumn Property of an Attribute](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Modify-the-KeyColumn-Property-of-an-Attribute.md).

 Select the source table for which you want to select its key columns. You can select the source table from a list of all tables in the Data Source View.
