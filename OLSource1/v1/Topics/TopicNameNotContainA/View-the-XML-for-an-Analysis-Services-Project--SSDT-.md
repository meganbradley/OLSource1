# View the XML for an Analysis Services Project (SSDT)
When you are working with an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] database in project mode, [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)] creates an XML definition for each object within the project folder. You can view the contents of the XML file for each object within [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)]. You can also edit the XML file directly; however, this is not recommended in most circumstances as you may make changes that make the XML unreadable by [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)].  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You cannot view the xml code for an entire project, but rather you view the code for each object because a separate file exists for each object. The only way to view the code for an entire project is to build the project and view the ASSL code in the <project name\>.asdatabase file.  
  
### To view the XML code for an object  
  
1.  Open the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] project in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)].  
  
2.  Right-click the object in Solution Explorer and then click **View Code**.  
  
     The XML code for the object appears in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)].
