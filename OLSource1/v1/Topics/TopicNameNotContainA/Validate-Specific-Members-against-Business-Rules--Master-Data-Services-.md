# Validate Specific Members against Business Rules (Master Data Services)
  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Token\Other/ssMDSshort_md.md)], apply business rules selectively when you want to update or validate subsets of members against business rules.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you want to apply business rules to all members in a version of a model, see [Validate a Version against Business Rules &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../Topic/Validate%20a%20Version%20against%20Business%20Rules%20\(Master%20Data%20Services\).md).  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have permission to access the **Explorer** functional area.  
  
-   You must have a minimum of **Update** permission to the model object you are applying business rules to.  
  
### To apply business rules selectively  
  
1.  On the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../../Token\Other/ssMDSmdm_md.md)] home page, from the **Model** drop\-down list, select a model.  
  
2.  From the **Version** drop\-down list, select a version.  
  
3.  Click **Explorer** tab.  
  
4.  From the menu bar, point to **Entities** and click the name of the entity that contains members you want to apply rules to.  
  
5.  Click **Apply Rules**. Business rules are applied only to the members displayed in the grid.
