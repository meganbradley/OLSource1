# XML Output File Format (ssbdiagnose)
The **ssbdiagnose** utility delivers its output as an XML file when you run it with the **-XML** switch. The XML output file lists header information and the errors that it found in the [!INCLUDE[ssSB](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSB_md.md)] configuration or conversation that was analyzed. You can write an application to analyze or report on the errors listed in the file. Or, you can view the XML file in a general XML editor, such as XML Notepad.  
  
 An **ssbdiangose** output file contains a DiagnosticInformation root element with two child types:  
  
-   A Banner element with header information.  
  
-   An Issue element for each issue that is reported by **ssbdiagnose**.
