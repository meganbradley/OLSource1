# Test for new conversion
The SQLServer:Dep\\\recated Features object in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] provides a counter to monitor the features designated as deprecated. In each case the counter provides a usage count that lists the number of times the deprecated feature was encountered since [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] last started.  
  
 The value of these counters are also available by executing the following statement:  
  
```  
SELECT \* FROM sys.dm_os_performance_counters   
WHERE object_name \= 'SQLServer:Deprecated Features';  
```  
  
 The following table describes the SQL Server Deprecated Features counter instances.  
  
```  
SELECT \* FROM sys.dm_os_performance_counters   
WHERE object_name \= 'SQLServer:Deprecated Features';  
```  
  
 The following table describes the SQL Server Deprecated Features counter instances.  
  
```  
SELECT \* FROM sys.dm_os_performance_counters   
WHERE object_name \= 'SQLServer:Deprecated Features';
