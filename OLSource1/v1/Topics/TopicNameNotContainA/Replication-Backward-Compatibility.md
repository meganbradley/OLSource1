# Replication Backward Compatibility
  Topics in the backward compatibility section describe changes in behavior between versions of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Token\Other/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] replication. It is important to understand backward compatibility if you are upgrading or if you have more than one version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] in a replication topology.  
  
 [Deprecated Features in SQL Server Replication](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/Deprecated-Features-in-SQL-Server-Replication.md)  
 Replication features that have been retained in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Token\Other/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Token\Other/ssCurrent_md.md)] for backward compatibility, but which will be removed in a future version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)].  
  
 [Breaking Changes in SQL Server Replication](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/Breaking-Changes-in-SQL-Server-Replication.md)  
 Replication feature changes that might require changes to applications.
