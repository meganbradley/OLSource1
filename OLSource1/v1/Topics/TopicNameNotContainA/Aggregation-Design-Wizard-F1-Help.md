# Aggregation Design Wizard F1 Help
  Aggregations provide performance improvements by allowing [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Token\Other/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssASnoversion_md.md)] to retrieve pre\-calculated totals directly from cube storage instead of having to recalculate data from an underlying data source for each query.  
  
 To design these aggregations, you can use the Aggregation Design Wizard. This wizard guides you through the following steps:  
  
-   Selecting standard or custom settings for the storage and caching options of a partition, measure group, or cube.  
  
-   Providing estimated or actual counts for objects referenced by the partition, measure group, or cube.  
  
-   Specifying aggregation options and limits to optimize the storage and query performance delivered by designed aggregations.  
  
-   Saving and optionally processing the partition, measure group, or cube to generate the defined aggregations.  
  
 After you use the Aggregation Design Wizard, you can use the Usage\-Based Optimization Wizard to design aggregations based on the usage patterns of the business users and client applications that query the cube.
