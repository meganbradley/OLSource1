# Define Database Dimensions
  Use Dimension Designer in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)] to configure an existing database dimension in a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Token\Other/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssASnoversion_md.md)] project or database. You can use Dimension Designer to do the following:  
  
-   Configure the dimension\-level properties.  
  
-   Add and configure dimension attributes.  
  
-   Define and configure user\-defined hierarchies.  
  
-   Define and configure relationships between attributes.  
  
-   Define dimension translations.  
  
-   For processed dimensions, you can browse the dimension structure and view data.  
  
 After you modify a dimension, attribute, or hierarchy, you must process that dimension to view the changes. When working in project mode, you deploy the changes to the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssASnoversion_md.md)] instance before processing.  
  
 For more information about how to open a dimension in Dimension Designer, see [Modify or Delete a Database Dimension in Solution Explorer](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/Modify-or-Delete-a-Database-Dimension-in-Solution-Explorer.md).  
  
 Dimension Designer has three different tabs, which are described in the following table.  
  
|Tab|Description|  
|---------|-----------------|  
|**Dimension Structure**|Use this tab to work with the structure of a dimension—to examine or create the data source view schema for a dimension, to work with attributes, and to organize attributes in user\-defined hierarchies.|  
|**Attribute Relationships**|Use this tab to create, modify, or delete the attribute relationships of a dimension.|  
|**Translations**|Use this tab to add and edit translations of dimension metadata in different languages.|  
|**Browser**|Use this tab to examine the members of a processed dimension and to review translations of dimension metadata.|  
  
 The following topics describe the tasks that you can perform in Dimension Designer.

 Describes how to define and configure a user\-defined hierarchy.  
  
 [Define Attribute Relationships](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/Define-Attribute-Relationships.md)
