# Full-Text Stoplist Properties
Use this dialog box to add or delete individual stopwords, delete all stopwords for a specific language, or clear the current stoplist. A stopword is a commonly used word that is included in a stoplist. The stopwords in a stoplist are omitted from full-text indexing for tables that use the stoplist. For more information, see [Configure and Manage Stopwords and Stoplists for Full-Text Search](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Configure-and-Manage-Stopwords-and-Stoplists-for-Full-Text-Search.md).

## Options  
 **Action**  
 Specifies the action that you want to perform.  
  
 **Add stopword**  
 Add a commonly used word to the stoplist.  
  
 **Delete stopword**  
 Delete a stopword from the stoplist.  
  
 **Delete all stopwords**  
 Delete all the stopwords for a specific language.  
  
 **Clear stoplist**  
 Clear the stoplist by deleting all the stopwords for all languages.  
  
 **Stopword**  
 If you selected **Add stopword** or **Delete stopword**, enter the stopword in the **Stopword** field. A new stopword must be unique; that is, not yet in this stoplist for the language that you select.  
  
 **Full-text language**  
 If you selected **Add stopword**, **Delete stopword**, or **Delete all stopwords**, select the language of the stopword or stopwords from the list box. This lists all the full-text languages that are supported by the server instance.
