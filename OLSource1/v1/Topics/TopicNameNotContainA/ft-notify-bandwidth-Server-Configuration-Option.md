# ft notify bandwidth Server Configuration Option
Use the **ft notify bandwidth** option to specify the size to which the pool of small memory buffers can grow. Small memory buffers are 64 kilobytes (KB) in size. The *max* parameter value specifies the maximum number of buffers that the full-text memory manager should maintain in a small buffer pool. If the **max** value is zero, then there is no upper limit to the number of buffers that can be in a small buffer pool.  
  
 The **min** parameter specifies the minimum number of memory buffers that must be maintained in the pool of small memory buffers. Upon request from the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] memory manager, all extra buffer pools will be released but this minimum number of buffers will be maintained. If, however, the **min** value specified is zero, then all memory buffers are released.  
  
 Under certain circumstances the number of buffers currently allocated is less than the value specified by the **min** parameter.
