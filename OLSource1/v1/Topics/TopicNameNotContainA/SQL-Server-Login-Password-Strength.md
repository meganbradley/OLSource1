# SQL Server Login Password Strength
This rule checks whether "Enforce password policy" of each [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] login is enabled. If [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Authentication is enabled and if the operating system version is earlier than [!INCLUDE[winxpsvr](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/winxpsvr_md.md)], an attacker could repeatedly exploit a known [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] login password.  
  
## Best Practices Recommendations  
 We recommend that you upgrade the operating system to [!INCLUDE[winxpsvr](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/winxpsvr_md.md)].  
  
 If [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Authentication is not required in your environment, use Windows Authentication.  
  
 Enable "Enforce password policy" for all the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] logins. Use [ALTER LOGIN](assetId:///e247b84e-c99e-4af8-8b50-57586e1cb1c5) to configure the password policy for the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] login.
