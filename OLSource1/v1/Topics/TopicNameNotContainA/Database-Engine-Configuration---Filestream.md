# Database Engine Configuration - Filestream
Use this page to enable FILESTREAM for this installation of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)]. FILESTREAM integrates the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDEnoversion_md.md)] with an NTFS file system by storing **varbinary(max)** binary large object (BLOB) data as files on the file system. [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/tsql_md.md)] statements can insert, update, query, search, and back up FILESTREAM data. Win32 file system interfaces provide streaming access to the data.
