# Data Mining Query Tasks and How-tos
  The ability to create queries is critical if you are to make use of your data mining models. This section provides links to examples of how to create queries against a data mining model by using the tools provided in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)]. If you need more information about what a data mining query is, or the different types of queries you can create, see [Data Mining Queries](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/Data-Mining-Queries.md).  
  
## Creating Queries with Prediction Query Builder  
 The Prediction Query Builder is provided in both [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] as a way of graphically building queries against data mining models. The following topics explain how you can select a model, specify a data source, customize the predictions, and save output.

-   [Create a Singleton Query in the Data Mining Designer](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/Create-a-Singleton-Query-in-the-Data-Mining-Designer.md)  
  
-   [Create a Prediction Query Using the Prediction Query Builder](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/Create-a-Prediction-Query-Using-the-Prediction-Query-Builder.md)  
  
-   [View and Save the Results of a Prediction Query](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/View-and-Save-the-Results-of-a-Prediction-Query.md)  
  
-   [Manually Edit a Prediction Query](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/Manually-Edit-a-Prediction-Query.md)  
  
-   [Apply Prediction Functions to a Model](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/Apply-Prediction-Functions-to-a-Model.md)  
  
-   [Choose and Map Input Data for a Prediction Query](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/Choose-and-Map-Input-Data-for-a-Prediction-Query.md)  
  
## Using Other Data Mining Query Tools  
 In addition to using the Prediction Query Builder, you can type a query directly into [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] by using DMX or by using XMLA. You can also build prediction queries programmatically and send them to an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssASnoversion_md.md)] server. The following topics provide more information about how to create and work with prediction queries outside of the Prediction Query Builder.  
  
 [Create a Singleton Prediction Query from a Template](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/Create-a-Singleton-Prediction-Query-from-a-Template.md)  
 Describes how to use the tools in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] to build and run a prediction query.  
  
 [Create a Singleton Prediction Query from a Template](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/Create-a-Singleton-Prediction-Query-from-a-Template.md)  
 Describes how to use the templates that are provided in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] to add parameters to a prediction query.  
  
 [Change the Time-out Value for Data Mining Queries](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/Change-the-Time-out-Value-for-Data-Mining-Queries.md)  
 Describes how to set properties on the server that control behavior related to data mining queries.  
  
 [Create a Content Query on a Mining Model](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/Create-a-Content-Query-on-a-Mining-Model.md)  
 Describes how to create queries that return detailed information that is stored in the mining model by using the data mining schema rowsets.  
  
 [Create a Data Mining Query by Using XMLA](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/Create-a-Data-Mining-Query-by-Using-XMLA.md)  
 Describes how to create a query against mining model content by using the XMLA templates in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssManStudioFull_md.md)].
