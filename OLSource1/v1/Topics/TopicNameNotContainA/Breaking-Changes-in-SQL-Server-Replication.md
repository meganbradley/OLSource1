  This topic describes breaking changes in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Replication. These changes might break applications, scripts, or functionalities that are based on earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)]. You might encounter these issues when you upgrade.
