# Database Engine Instances (SQL Server)
An instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)] is a copy of the **sqlservr.exe** executable that runs as an operating system service. Each instance manages several system databases and one or more user databases. Each computer can run multiple instances of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)]. Applications connect to the instance in order to perform work in a database managed by the instance.  
  
## Instances  
 An instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)] operates as a service that handles all application requests to work with the data in any of the databases managed by that instance. It is the target of the connection requests (logins) from applications. The connection runs through a network connection if the application and instance are on separate computers. If the application and instance are on the same computer, the SQL Server connection can run as either a network connection or an in-memory connection. When a connection has been completed, an application sends [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/tsql_md.md)] statements across the connection to the instance. The instance resolves the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/tsql_md.md)] statements into operations against the data and objects in the databases, and if the required permissions have been granted to the login credentials, performs the work. Any data retrieved is returned to the application, along with any messages such as errors.  
  
 You can run multiple instances of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)] on a computer. One instance can be the default instance. The default instance has no name. If a connection request specifies only the name of the computer, the connection is made to the default instance. A named instance is one where you specify an instance name when installing the instance. A connection request must specify both the computer name and instance name in order to connect to the instance. There is no requirement to install a default instance; all of the instances running on a computer can be named instances.
