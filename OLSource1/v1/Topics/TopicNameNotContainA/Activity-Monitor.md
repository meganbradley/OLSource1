# Activity Monitor
Activity Monitor displays information about [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] processes and how these processes affect the current instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)].  
  
## Benefits of Activity Monitor  
 Activity Monitor is a tabbed document window that has the following expandable and collapsible panes: **Overview**, **Active User Tasks**, **Resource Waits**, **Data File I/O**, and **Recent Expensive Queries**. When any pane is expanded, Activity Monitor queries the instance for information. When a pane is collapsed, all querying activity stops for that pane. You can also expand one or more panes at the same time to view different kinds of activity on the instance.  
  
 For the columns that are included in the **Active User Tasks**, **Resource Waits**, **Data File I/O**, and **Recent Expensive Queries** panes, you can customize the display in the following ways:  
  
1.  To rearrange the order of the columns, click the column heading and drag it to another location in the heading ribbon.  
  
2.  To sort a column, click the column name.  
  
3.  To filter on one or more columns, click the drop-down arrow in the column heading, and then select a value.
