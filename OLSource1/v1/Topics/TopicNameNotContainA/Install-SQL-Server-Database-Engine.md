# Install SQL Server Database Engine
The [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)] component of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] is the core service for storing, processing, and securing data. The [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)] provides controlled access and rapid transaction processing to meet the requirements of the most demanding data consuming applications in your enterprise.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] supports up to 50 instances of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)] on a single computer. To create a typical [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] installation, see [Install SQL Server 2016 from the Installation Wizard (Setup)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Install-SQL-Server-2016-from-the-Installation-Wizard--Setup-.md).  
  
 **Important** For local installations, you must run Setup as an administrator. If you install [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] from a remote share, you must use a domain account that has read and execute permissions on the remote share.  
  
 The following features are installed when you select **[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Database Engine** on the Components to Install page of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Installation Wizard:

-   Replication - is an optional component  
  
-   Full-Text Search - is an optional component  
  
-   Data Quality Services â€“ is an optional component  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  In this release, selecting the **Data Quality Services** check box in setup does not install the Data Quality Services (DQS) server. You will have to perform additional steps post installation to install DQS server. For more information, see [Install Data Quality Services](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Install-Data-Quality-Services.md).  
  
 The following additional features are options for many typical user scenarios:

-   Documentation components  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  By default, sample databases and sample code are not installed as part of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Setup. To install sample databases and sample code, see the [CodePlex Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=87843).
