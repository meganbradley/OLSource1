# Install SQL Server Replication
Replication components can be installed by using the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Installation Wizard or at a command prompt. Install replication when you install [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)], or when you modify an existing instance.  
  
 After replication components are installed, you must configure the server before you can use replication. For more information, see [Configure Distribution](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Configure-Distribution.md) in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Books Online.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If you install replication components when you modify an existing instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)], you must stop and restart [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent after the installation is completed. This action helps ensure that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent recognizes the replication agent subsystems and can call replication agents from job steps.  
  
## Installing Replication by Using Setup  
 **To install replication when installing a new instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)]**  
  
-   To install replication components, including Replication Management Objects (RMO), select **SQL Server Replication** on the **Feature Selection** page of the Installation Wizard.  
  
## Installing Replication from the Command Prompt  
 **To install replication when installing a new instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)]**  
  
-   See [Install SQL Server 2016 from the Command Prompt](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Install-SQL-Server-2016-from-the-Command-Prompt.md).
