# Prediction Query Builder (Data Mining)
  Use the **Mining Model Prediction** view to create predictions based on mining models that a mining structure contains.  
  
 For a walkthrough of how to use the Prediction Query Builder to create data mining queries, we recommend that you review the following tutorials and topics:  
  
-   [Basic Data Mining Tutorial](../Topic/Basic%20Data%20Mining%20Tutorial.md)  
  
-   [Creating and Querying Data Mining Models with DMX: Tutorials &#40;Analysis Services - Data Mining&#41;](../Topic/Creating%20and%20Querying%20Data%20Mining%20Models%20with%20DMX:%20Tutorials%20\(Analysis%20Services%20-%20Data%20Mining\).md)  
  
-   [Data Mining Queries](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/Data-Mining-Queries.md)  
  
-   [Data Mining Query Tasks and How-tos](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/Data-Mining-Query-Tasks-and-How-tos.md)  
  
 The **Mining Model Prediction** view has the following tools and dialog boxes:
