# Choose the Deployment Location
  Use this page of the Report Wizard to set the deployment server and folder for the report server project.  
  
## Options  
 **Report server**  
 Type the URL of the virtual directory of the report server, for example, http:\/\/localhost\/reportserver. This is the virtual directory of the report server, not Report Manager. By default, the report server is installed with a virtual directory named reportserver.  
  
 **Deployment folder**  
 Type the name of the destination folder for publishing the reports that are contained within the report server project. The default value for the folder is the name of the project. If the folder does not exist on the report server, Report Designer creates the folder when the reports are published.
