# Check Integrity of Database with Suspect Pages
This rule checks for user databases that have the database status set to suspect. When the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDEnoversion_md.md)] reads a database page that contains an 824 error, the page is considered suspect, its page ID is recorded in the suspect_pages table in msdb, and the database that contains the page is set to suspect.  
  
 Error 824 indicates that a logical consistency error was detected during a read operation. This error frequently indicates data corruption caused by a faulty I/O subsystem component. This is a severe error condition that threatens database integrity and must be corrected immediately.  
  
## Best Practices Recommendations  
  
-   Review the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] error log for the details of the 824 error for this database.  
  
-   Complete a full database consistency check ([DBCC CHECKDB](assetId:///2c506167-0b69-49f7-9282-241e411910df)).  
  
-   Implement the user actions that are defined in [MSSQLSERVER_824](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=81397).
