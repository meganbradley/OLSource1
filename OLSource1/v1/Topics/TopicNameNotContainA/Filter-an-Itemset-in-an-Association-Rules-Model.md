# Filter an Itemset in an Association Rules Model
In [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)], you can filter the itemsets that are displayed in the **Itemsets** tab of the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] Association Rules Viewer.  
  
### To filter an itemset  
  
1.  On the **Mining Model Viewer** tab of Data Mining Designer in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)], click the **Itemsets** tab of the **Association Rules Viewer**.  
  
2.  Enter a rule condition in the **Filter itemset** box. For example, a rule condition might be "Touring-1000 = existing"  
  
3.  Click **Enter**.  
  
 The itemsets are now filtered to display only those itemsets that contain the selected items. The box is not case-sensitive. Filters are stored in memory so that you can select an old filter from the list.
