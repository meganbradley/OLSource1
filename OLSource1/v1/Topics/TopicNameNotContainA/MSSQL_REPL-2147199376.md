Drop any unused subscription registrations for this partition or change the partitioning options for the article.|  
  
## Explanation  
 When a publication contains one or more articles that were configured by using *partition\_options*\=3, the merge process checks to make sure that there is only one subscription per partition.  
  
## User Action  
 If the publication contains stale subscriptions, drop these subscriptions by using **sp\_dropmergesubscription**.
