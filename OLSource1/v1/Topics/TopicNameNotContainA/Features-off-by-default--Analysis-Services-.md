# Features off by default (Analysis Services)
An instance of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] is designed to be secure by default. Therefore, features that might compromise security are disabled by default. The following features are installed in a disabled state and must specifically be enabled if you want to use them.  
  
## Feature List  
 To enable the following features, connect to [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)]. Right-click the instance name and choose **Facets**. Alternatively, you can enable these features through server properties, as described in the next section.  
  
-   Ad Hoc Data Mining (OpenRowset) Queries  
  
-   Linked Objects (To)  
  
-   Linked Objects (From)  
  
-   Listen Only On Local Connections  
  
-   User Defined Functions

Connect to [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)]. Right-click the instance name and choose **Properties**. Click **General**, and then click **Show Advanced** to display a larger property list.
