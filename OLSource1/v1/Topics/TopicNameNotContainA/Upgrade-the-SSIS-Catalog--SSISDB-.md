# Upgrade the SSIS Catalog (SSISDB)
Run the SSISDB Upgrade Wizard to upgrade the SSIS Catalog database, SSISDB, when the database is older than the current version of the SQL Server instance. This occurs when one of the following conditions is true.  
  
-   You restored the database from an older version of SQL Server.  
  
-   You did not remove the database from an Always On Availability Group before upgrading the SQL Server instance. This prevents the automatic upgrade of the database. For more info, see [Upgrading SSISDB in an availability group](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Always-On-for-SSIS-Catalog--SSISDB-.md#Upgrade).  
  
 The wizard can only upgrade the database on a local  server instance.
