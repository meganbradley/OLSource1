# Example: Piecemeal Restore of Database (Simple Recovery Model)
A piecemeal restore sequence restores and recovers a database in stages at the filegroup level, starting with the primary and all read/write, secondary filegroups.  
  
 In this example, database `adb` is restored to a new computer after a disaster. The database is using the simple recovery model. Before the disaster, all the filegroups are online. Filegroups `A` and `C` are read/write, and filegroup `B` is read-only. Filegroup `B` became read-only before the most recent partial backup, which contains the primary filegroup and the read/write secondary filegroups, `A` and `C`. After filegroup `B` became read-only, a separate file backup of filegroup `B` was taken.  
  
## Restore Sequences  
  
1.  Partial restore of the primary and filegroups `A` and `C`.  
  
    ```  
    RESTORE DATABASE adb FILEGROUP='A',FILEGROUP='C'   
       FROM partial_backup   
       WITH PARTIAL, RECOVERY;  
  
    ```  
  
     At this point, the primary and filegroups `A` and `C` are online. All files in filegroup `B` are recovery pending, and the filegroup is offline.  
  
2.  Online restore of filegroup `B`.  
  
    ```  
    RESTORE DATABASE adb FILEGROUP='B' FROM backup WITH RECOVERY;  
  
    ```  
  
     All filegroups are now online.
