# SetDatabaseConnection Method (WMI MSReportServer_ConfigurationSetting)
Sets the report server database connection to a particular report server database.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```vb#  
Public Sub SetDatabaseConnection(Server as String, _  
    DatabaseName as string, CredentialsType as Integer, _  
    Username as String, Password as String, ByRef HRESULT as Int32)  
```  
  
```c#  
public void BackupEncryptionKey(string Server,   
    string DatabaseName, Int32 CredentialsType,   
    string UserName, string Password, out Int32 HRESULT);  
```  
  
## Parameters  
 *Server*  
 The name of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] instance that is used to host the report server database.  
  
 *DatabaseName*  
 The name of the report server database.  
  
 *CredentialsType*  
 The type of credentials to use for the connection. Values can be:  
  
-   0 - Windows  
  
-   1 – [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)]  
  
-   2 - Windows Service  
  
 *UserName*  
 The account name used to connect to the report server database.  
  
 *Password*  
 The password used to connect to the report server database.  
  
 *HRESULT*  
 [out] Value indicating whether the call succeeded or failed.  
  
## Return Value  
 Returns an *HRESULT* indicating success or failure of the method call. A value of 0 indicates that the method call was successful. A non-zero value indicates that an error has occurred.  
  
## Remarks  
 When the *CredentialsType* parameter is set to 0 (Windows), the *UserName* and *Password* parameters must be set. The *UserName* parameter must be in the form "domain\username", and the value must represent a valid Windows logon.  
  
 When the *CredentialsType* parameter is set to 1 ([!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)]), the value passed in the *UserName* parameter must conform to the requirements of a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] login name.  
  
 When the *CredentialsType* parameter is set to 2 (Windows Service), the report server uses integrated security to connect to the report server database and the *UserName* and *Password* parameters are ignored. The Reporting Server Web service will use either the [!INCLUDE[vstecasp](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/vstecasp_md.md)] account or an application pool’s account and the Windows service account to access the report server database.  
  
 When called, the **SetDatabaseConnection** method encrypts and stores the credentials and database information in the configuration file for the specified report server.  
  
 The **SetDatabaseConnection** method does not check that the report server can connect to the report server database using the data specified.  
  
 When set for the first time, the **ConnectionPoolSize** property is set based on the following processors: **ConnectionPoolSize** = #Processors * 75.  
  
 The **SetDatabaseConnection** method does not grant permissions to the specified account(s). You must call the [GenerateDatabaseRightsScript](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/GenerateDatabaseRightsScript-Method--WMI-MSReportServer_ConfigurationSetting-.md) method for each account that requires access to the report server database and run the resulting script.
