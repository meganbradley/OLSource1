# Notify Operator Task
  The Notify Operator task sends notification messages to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent operators. AÂ [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent operator is an alias for a person or group that can receive electronic notifications. For more information about [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] operators, see [Operators](../Topic/Operators.md).  
  
 By using the Notify Operator task, a package can notify one or more operators via e\-mail, pager, or **net send**. Each operator can be notified by different methods. For example, OperatorA is notified by e\-mail and pager, and OperatorB is notified by pager and **net send**. The operators who receive notifications from the task must be members of the **OperatorNotify** collection on the Notify Operator task.  
  
 The Notify Operator task is the only database maintenance task that does not encapsulate a Transact\-SQL statement or a DBCC command.  
  
## Configuration of the Notify Operator Task  
 You can set properties through [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../Token\Other/ssIS_md.md)] Designer. This task is in the **Maintenance Plan Tasks** section of the **Toolbox** in [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../Token\Other/ssIS_md.md)] Designer.
