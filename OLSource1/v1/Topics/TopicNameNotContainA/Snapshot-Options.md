# Snapshot Options
There are a number of options available when initializing a subscription with a snapshot:  
  
-   Specify an alternate snapshot folder location instead of or in addition to the default snapshot folder location. For more information, see [Alternate Snapshot Folder Locations](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Alternate-Snapshot-Folder-Locations.md).  
  
-   Compress snapshots for storage on removable media or for transfer over a slow network. For more information, see [Compressed Snapshots](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Compressed-Snapshots.md).  
  
-   Execute [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/tsql_md.md)] scripts before or after the snapshot is applied. For more information, see [Execute Scripts Before and After the Snapshot Is Applied](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Execute-Scripts-Before-and-After-the-Snapshot-Is-Applied.md).  
  
-   Transfer snapshot files using File Transfer Protocol (FTP). For more information, see [Transfer Snapshots Through FTP](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Transfer-Snapshots-Through-FTP.md).
