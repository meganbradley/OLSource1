# Complete the Database Engine Upgrade
After the upgrade to SQL Server 2016 is complete, there are a number of additional steps that you may need to take. These include the following:  
  
 After upgrading the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)], complete the following tasks:  
  
-   **Backup your databases:** Perform a full backup of each upgraded database.  
  
-   **Enable new features:** In SQL Server 2016, some changes are only enabled once the DATABASE_COMPATIBILITY level for a database has been changed to 130.  For more information and for the recommended workflow, see [Change the Database Compatibility Mode and Use the Query Store](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Change-the-Database-Compatibility-Mode-and-Use-the-Query-Store.md).  
  
-   **Integration Services:**  
  
     Migrate Integration Services packages to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] format. For more information, see [Upgrade Integration Services Packages](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Upgrade-Integration-Services-Packages.md).  
  
-   **Reporting Services:** For a new installation upgrade, restore the Reporting Services  encryption Keys. For more information, see [Back Up and Restore Reporting Services Encryption Keys](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Back-Up-and-Restore-Reporting-Services-Encryption-Keys.md).  
  
-   **Master Data Services:**  Upgrade the MDS database schema and create the SQL Server 2016 web application. For more information, see [Upgrade Master Data Services](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Upgrade-Master-Data-Services.md).  
  
-   **Data Quality Services:** Upgrade the DQS databases schema and verify the DQS databases schema upgrade. For more information, see [Upgrade Data Quality Services](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Upgrade-Data-Quality-Services.md).  
  
-   **Full Text Search:** Re-populate full-text catalogs to ensure semantic consistency in query results. For more information, see [Populate Full-Text Indexes](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Populate-Full-Text-Indexes.md).
