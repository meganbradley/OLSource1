 This page describes how to start the Wizard. For more info about the Wizard and how it works, including a list of the steps in the wizard, see [SQL Server Import and Export Wizard](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/SQL-Server-Import-and-Export-Wizard.md) .

## Get the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard  
 If you don't have [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] installed on your computer, you can install the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Import and Export Wizard  by installing SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT). For more info, see [Download SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt204009.aspx).  
  
 You may also have to install additional files to connect to certain data sources and destinations. For more info, see [Data sources that you can use](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/SQL-Server-Import-and-Export-Wizard.md#wizardSources).  
  
## Start the wizard from SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)], connect to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)], expand **Databases**, right-click a database, point to **Tasks**, and then click one of the following options.

 Run the 64-bit version of the Wizard unless you know that your data source requires a 32-bit data provider.  
  
## Start the wizard from the command prompt  
 In a Command Prompt window, run **DTSWizard.exe** from one of the following locations.  
  
-   **C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\130\DTS\Binn** for the 64-bit version.  
  
-   **C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\130\DTS\Binn** for the 32-bit version.  
  
 Run the 64-bit version of the Wizard unless you know that your data source requires a 32-bit data provider.  
  
## Start the wizard from Visual Studio with SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)
