# Delete Packages
  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)], you can delete packages saved to the file system. If you delete a package, it is deleted permanently and it cannot be restored to an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssISnoversion_md.md)] project.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you want to remove packages from an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssISnoversion_md.md)] project, but use them in other projects, then you should use the **Exclude From Project** option instead of the **Delete** option.
