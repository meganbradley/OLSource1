# Change Tracking (Master Data Services)
  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Token\Other/ssMDSshort_md.md)], you can use change tracking groups to take action when an attribute value changes. Use change tracking when you donâ€™t know what the new value will be, but instead want to know if any change occurred.  
  
## Configuring Change Tracking  
 To configure change tracking, you add an attribute to a change tracking group. The group can contain one or many attributes. Then, you create a business rule to define the action that is taken when any of the attributes in the group change.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Change tracking business rules consider staged \(imported\) data to be changed.
