# Integration Services Transformations
[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] transformations are the components in the data flow of a package that aggregate, merge, distribute, and modify data. Transformations can also perform lookup operations and generate sample datasets. This section describes the transformations that [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] includes and explains how they work.  
  
## Business Intelligence Transformations  
 The following transformations perform business intelligence operations such as cleaning data, mining text, and running data mining prediction queries.  
  
|Transformation|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|[Slowly Changing Dimension Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Slowly-Changing-Dimension-Transformation.md)|The transformation that configures the updating of a slowly changing dimension.|  
|[Fuzzy Grouping Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Fuzzy-Grouping-Transformation.md)|The transformation that standardizes values in column data.|  
|[Fuzzy Lookup Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Fuzzy-Lookup-Transformation.md)|The transformation that looks up values in a reference table using a fuzzy match.|  
|[Term Extraction Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Term-Extraction-Transformation.md)|The transformation that extracts terms from text.|  
|[Term Lookup Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Term-Lookup-Transformation.md)|The transformation that looks up terms in a reference table and counts terms extracted from text.|  
|[Data Mining Query Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Data-Mining-Query-Transformation.md)|The transformation that runs data mining prediction queries.|  
|[DQS Cleansing Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/DQS-Cleansing-Transformation.md)|The transformation that corrects data from a connected data source by applying rules that were created for the data source.|  
  
## Row Transformations  
 The following transformations update column values and create new columns. The transformation is applied to each row in the transformation input.  
  
|Transformation|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|[Character Map Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Character-Map-Transformation.md)|The transformation that applies string functions to character data.|  
|[Copy Column Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Copy-Column-Transformation.md)|The transformation that adds copies of input columns to the transformation output.|  
|[Data Conversion Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Data-Conversion-Transformation.md)|The transformation that converts the data type of a column to a different data type.|  
|[Derived Column Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Derived-Column-Transformation.md)|The transformation that populates columns with the results of expressions.|  
|[Export Column Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Export-Column-Transformation.md)|The transformation that inserts data from a data flow into a file.|  
|[Import Column Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Import-Column-Transformation.md)|The transformation that reads data from a file and adds it to a data flow.|  
|[Script Component](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Script-Component.md)|The transformation that uses script to extract, transform, or load data.|  
|[OLE DB Command Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/OLE-DB-Command-Transformation.md)|The transformation that runs SQL commands for each row in a data flow.|  
  
## Rowset Transformations  
 The following transformations create new rowsets. The rowset can include aggregate and sorted values, sample rowsets, or pivoted and unpivoted rowsets.  
  
|Transformation|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|[Aggregate Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Aggregate-Transformation.md)|The transformation that performs aggregations such as AVERAGE, SUM, and COUNT.|  
|[Sort Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Sort-Transformation.md)|The transformation that sorts data.|  
|[Percentage Sampling Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Percentage-Sampling-Transformation.md)|The transformation that creates a sample data set using a percentage to specify the sample size.|  
|[Row Sampling Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Row-Sampling-Transformation.md)|The transformation that creates a sample data set by specifying the number of rows in the sample.|  
|[Pivot Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Pivot-Transformation.md)|The transformation that creates a less normalized version of a normalized table.|  
|[Unpivot Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Unpivot-Transformation.md)|The transformation that creates a more normalized version of a nonnormalized table.|  
  
## Split and Join Transformations  
 The following transformations distribute rows to different outputs, create copies of the transformation inputs, join multiple inputs into one output, and perform lookup operations.  
  
|Transformation|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|[Conditional Split Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Conditional-Split-Transformation.md)|The transformation that routes data rows to different outputs.|  
|[Multicast Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Multicast-Transformation.md)|The transformation that distributes data sets to multiple outputs.|  
|[Union All Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Union-All-Transformation.md)|The transformation that merges multiple data sets.|  
|[Merge Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Merge-Transformation.md)|The transformation that merges two sorted data sets.|  
|[Merge Join Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Merge-Join-Transformation.md)|The transformation that joins two data sets using a FULL, LEFT, or INNER join.|  
|[Lookup Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Lookup-Transformation.md)|The transformation that looks up values in a reference table using an exact match.|  
|[Cache Transform](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Cache-Transform.md)|The transformation that writes data from a connected data source in the data flow to a Cache connection manager that saves the data to a cache file. The Lookup transformation performs lookups on the data in the cache file.|  
|[Balanced Data Distributor Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Balanced-Data-Distributor-Transformation.md)|The transformation distributes buffers of incoming rows uniformly across outputs on separate threads to improve performance of SSIS packages running on multi-core and multi-processor servers.|  
  
## Auditing Transformations  
 [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] includes the following transformations to add audit information and count rows.  
  
|Transformation|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|[Audit Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Audit-Transformation.md)|The transformation that makes information about the environment available to the data flow in a package.|  
|[Row Count Transformation](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Row-Count-Transformation.md)|The transformation that counts rows as they move through it and stores the final count in a variable.|  
  
## Custom Transformations  
 You can also write custom transformations. For more information, see [Creating a Transformation Component with Synchronous Outputs](assetId:///b694d21f-9919-402d-9192-666c6449b0b7) and [Creating a Transformation Component with Asynchronous Outputs](assetId:///1c3e92c7-a4fa-4fdd-b9ca-ac3069536274).
