# Expression Reference (Report Builder and SSRS)
  Report expressions support a variety of references to built\-in functions and built\-in collections. Expressions must have valid [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../Token\Other/vbprvb_md.md)] syntax before a report can be published or processed.  
  
 To develop complex expressions or expressions that use custom code or custom assemblies, we recommend that you use Report Designer in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)]. For more information, see [Custom Code and Assembly References in Expressions in Report Designer &#40;SSRS&#41;](../Topic/Custom%20Code%20and%20Assembly%20References%20in%20Expressions%20in%20Report%20Designer%20\(SSRS\).md).
