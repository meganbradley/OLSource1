# Expression Reference (Report Builder and SSRS)
Report expressions support a variety of references to built-in functions and built-in collections. Expressions must have valid [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] syntax before a report can be published or processed.  
  
 To develop complex expressions or expressions that use custom code or custom assemblies, we recommend that you use Report Designer in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)]. For more information, see [Custom Code and Assembly References in Expressions in Report Designer (SSRS)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Custom-Code-and-Assembly-References-in-Expressions-in-Report-Designer--SSRS-.md).
