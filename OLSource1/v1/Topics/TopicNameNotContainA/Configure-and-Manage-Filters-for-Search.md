# Configure and Manage Filters for Search
Indexing documents in an **varbinary**, **varbinary(max)**, **image**, or **xml** data type column requires extra processing. This processing must be performed by a filter. The filter extracts the textual information from the document (removing the formatting). The filter then sends the text to the word-breaker component for the language associated with the table column.  
  
 A given filter is specific to a given document type (.doc, .pdf, .xls, .xml, and so forth). These filters implement the IFilter interface. For more information about these document types, query the [sys.fulltext_document_types](assetId:///156fcfa4-7304-4a5c-b96f-1c3e061e5df0) catalog view.  
  
 Binary documents can be stored in a single **varbinary(max)** or **image** column. For each document, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] chooses the correct filter based on the file extension. Because the file extension is not visible when the file is stored in a **varbinary(max)** or **image** column, the file extension (.doc, .xls,  .pdf, and so forth) must be stored in a separate column in the table, called a type column. This type column can be of any character-based data type and contains the document file extension, such as .doc for a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] Word document. In the **Document** table in [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBCoShort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSampleDBCoShort_md.md)], the **Document** column is of type **varbinary(max)**, and the type column, **FileExtension**, is of type **nvarchar(8)**.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  A filter might be able to handle objects embedded in the parent object, depending on its implementation. However, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] does not configure filters to follow links to other objects.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] installs its own XML and HTML filters. In addition, any filters for [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] proprietary formats (.doc, .xdoc, .ppt and so on) that are already installed on the operating system are also loaded by  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)]. To identify the filters that are currently loaded on an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)], use the [sp_help_fulltext_system_components](assetId:///ac1fc7a0-7f46-4a12-8c5c-8d378226a8ce) stored procedure, as follows:  
  
```  
EXEC sp_help_fulltext_system_components 'filter';   
```  
  
 Before you can use filters for non [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] formats, however, you must manually load them into the server instance. For information about installing additional filters, see [View or Change Registered Filters and Word Breakers](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/View-or-Change-Registered-Filters-and-Word-Breakers.md).
