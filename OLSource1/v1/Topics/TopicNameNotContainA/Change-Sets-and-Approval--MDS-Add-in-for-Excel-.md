# Change Sets and Approval (MDS Add-in for Excel)
In the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)] Add-in for Excel, you can save pending changes to an entity in a change set. You can apply an existing change set in order to view and modify the pending changes, and you can commit an existing change set.  
  
 If the entity requires approval for changes, you must save the pending changes into a change set and submit for approval. For more information, see [Approval Required (Master Data Services)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Approval-Required--Master-Data-Services-.md)
