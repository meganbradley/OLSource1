# Deployment Checklist: Install Reporting Services into an Existing SharePoint Farm
[!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] SharePoint report servers can be installed into a new SharePoint Farm or into an existing SharePoint farm. This topic describes the possible scenarios and best practices for installing [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] into and existing SharePoint farm.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 Before you run Setup, review the following information:  
  
|Step|Link|  
|----------|----------|  
|Create or identify the accounts used in a report server deployment. You must have a service account for the Report Server service, and credentials for connecting to the report server database||  
|Decide on an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] to host the report server database. You can use a local or remote instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)]. You should choose an instance that is on a computer that has the storage capacity to accommodate your reports.||  
|(Optional) Find the name of the SMTP server or gateway that provides e-mail service to your organization if you want to use report server e-mail in subscriptions|[Configure a Report Server for E-Mail Delivery (SSRS Configuration Manager)](assetId:///b838f970-d11a-4239-b164-8d11f4581d83)|  
  
## Installation Scenarios  
 The following table describes the possible scenarios when you are installing [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] into and existing SharePoint Farm. Local mode allows reports to be rendered locally from the SharePoint document library, without integration with a [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] report server. The [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] add-in for SharePoint products is required but a [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] report server is not. For more information on local mode, see [Local Mode vs. Connected Mode Reports in the Report Viewer (Reporting Services in SharePoint Mode)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Local-Mode-vs.-Connected-Mode-Reports-in-the-Report-Viewer--Reporting-Services-in-SharePoint-Mode-.md) and [Where to find the Reporting Services add-in for SharePoint Products](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Where-to-find-the-Reporting-Services-add-in-for-SharePoint-Products.md).
