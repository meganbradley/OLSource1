Use the **Preview** node of the **Flat File Connection Manager Editor** dialog box to view the contents of the source file in a tabular format.  
  
 To learn more about the Flat File connection manager, see [Flat File Connection Manager](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Flat-File-Connection-Manager.md).  
  
## Options  
 **Connection manager name**  
 Provide a unique name for the Flat File connection in the workflow. The name provided will be displayed within [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssIS_md.md)] Designer.  
  
 **Description**  
 Describe the connection. As a best practice, describe the connection in terms of its purpose, to make packages self-documenting and easier to maintain.  
  
 **Data rows to skip**  
 Specify how many rows to skip at the beginning of the flat file.  
  
 **Refresh**  
 View the effect of changing the number of rows to skip by clicking **Refresh**. This button only becomes visible after you have changed other connection options.  
  
 **Preview rows**  
 View sample data in the flat file, divided into columns and rows according to the options you have selected.
