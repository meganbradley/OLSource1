# Generate SQL Script (Replication Objects)
A replication script contains the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/tsql_md.md)] system stored procedures necessary to implement the replication components scripted, such as a publication or subscription. All replication components in a topology should be scripted as part of a disaster recovery plan, and scripts can also be used to automate repetitive tasks. Replication offers two dialog boxes for scripting replication objects:  
  
-   **Generate SQL Script**, which is available from the context menu of the **Replication** folder and all subfolders in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)]. This dialog box allows you to script all replication objects on an instance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)].  
  
-   **Generate SQL Script <ObjectName\>**, which is available from the context menu for publications and subscriptions. This dialog box allows you to script individual objects.  
  
 These dialog boxes script objects on a single instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)]; they do not connect to other instances to script related objects.  
  
## Generate SQL Script Options  
 **Distributor properties**  
 Select to script stored procedures to: enable or disable the Distributor; add or drop Publishers associated with the Distributor; and create or drop the distribution database.  
  
 **Publications in the following data sources**  
 Select to script stored procedures to: enable or disable publishing; and create or drop publications, articles, push subscriptions, and replication jobs.  
  
 **Subscriptions in the following data sources**  
 Select to script stored procedures to create or drop pull subscriptions and replication jobs.  
  
 **To create or enable the components** and **To drop or disable the components**  
 Specify whether the script should include commands for creating or dropping a replication object. [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] recommends that you use the dialog box to create a set of scripts for enabling and disabling components.  
  
 **Replication jobs**  
 Select to script replication jobs in addition to stored procedure calls. This option is available only when scripting from a Distributor.  
  
 Replication stored procedures create the necessary jobs when they are executed, so it is not required to select this option. However, it can be useful to have a record of the jobs created in case an individual job must be recreated.  
  
## Generate SQL Script <ObjectName\> Options  
 **To create or enable the components** and **To drop or disable the components**  
 Specify whether the script should include commands for creating or dropping a replication object. [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] recommends that you use the dialog box, creating a set of scripts for enabling and disabling components.  
  
 **Replication jobs**  
 This option is available only from the **Generate SQL Script** dialog box.
