# Configure Flat File Destination (SQL Server Import and Export Wizard)
If you selected a flat file destination, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Import and Export Wizard shows **Configure Flat File Destination** after you specify that  you want to copy an entire table or after you provide a query. On this page, you specify formatting options for the destination flat file. Optionally you choose columns and preview sample data.  
  
> [!TIP]  
>  There is no option to specify a custom row delimiter or column delimiter on this page. To continue to use the wizard, consider whether you can do a global search and replace operation in the flat file to replace the existing delimiter with one of the delimiters recognized  by the wizard.  
  
 For more info about the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Import and Export Wizard and how it works, see [SQL Server Import and Export Wizard](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/SQL-Server-Import-and-Export-Wizard.md).  
  
## Screen shot  
 The following screen shot shows the **Configure Flat File Destination** page of the Wizard.

## What's next?  
 After you specify formatting options for the destination flat file, the next page depends on the option that you choose.  
  
-   Optionally click **Edit mappings** to display the **Column Mappings** dialog box. Use the **Column Mappings** dialog box to specify destination columns to receive the source data. You can copy only a subset of columns by selecting <ignore\> in the **Destination** column of the **Column Mappings** dialog box for columns that you don't want to copy.  
  
-   Optionally click **Preview** to preview up to 200 rows of sample data in the **Preview Data** dialog box. This helps you to confirm that the wizard is going to copy the data that you want to copy.  
  
     After you preview the data, you may want to change the options that you selected on previous pages of the wizard. To make these changes, on the **Select Source Tables and Views** page, click **Back** to return to previous pages where you can change your selections.  
  
-   If you don't display one of the optional dialog boxes, the next page is **Save and Execute Package**. On this page, you specify whether you want to run the copy operation immediately. Depending on your configuration, you may also be able to save the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] package created by the wizard  to customize it and to reuse it.
