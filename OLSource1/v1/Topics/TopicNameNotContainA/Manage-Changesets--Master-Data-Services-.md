# Manage Changesets (Master Data Services)
  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Token\Other/ssMDSshort_md.md)] you can manage all changes by model and version.  
  
## Prerequisites  
  
-   You must have permission to access the **Explorer** functional area. For more information, see [Functional Area Permissions &#40;Master Data Services&#41;](../Topic/Functional%20Area%20Permissions%20\(Master%20Data%20Services\).md).  
  
-   You must have at least read access to the entity or one of its attributes.  
  
-   If you are an Entity Administrator, you can manage the changesets you created or the changesets that are pending for approval.  
  
-   If you are not an Entity Administrator, you can only manage the changesets you created.  
  
## To manage the changesets  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../../Token\Other/ssMDSmdm_md.md)], select the model and version and then click **Explorer**.  
  
2.  Click **Changesets**. All the changesets that you can manage for the selected model and version, are displayed.  
  
3.  Click **Apply** to view the changeset details.  
  
4.  Click **Delete** to delete a changeset. You can only delete a changeset that is not in a pending or approved state.  
  
5.  Click **Add** to add a changeset.  
  
6.  Click **Edit** to edit a changeset.
