# Create, Construct, and Query geography Instances
The geography spatial data type, **geography**, represents data in a round-earth coordinate system. This type is implemented as a .NET common language runtime (CLR) data type in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)]. The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] **geography** data type stores ellipsoidal (round-earth) data, such as GPS latitude and longitude coordinates.  
  
 The **geography** type is predefined and available in each database. You can create table columns of type **geography** and operate on **geography** data in the same manner as you would use other system-supplied types.

Two-dimensional instances, such as **Polygon, CurvePolygon**, and **MultiPolygon**, have area and length. Empty instances report a dimension of -1, and a **GeometryCollection** reports the maximum dimension of its contents.

##  <a name="supportedsrid"></a> geography Instances Must Use Supported SRID  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] supports SRIDs based on the EPSG standards. A [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)]-supported SRID for **geography** instances must be used when performing calculations or using methods with geography spatial data. The SRID must match one of the SRIDs displayed in the **sys.spatial_reference_systems** catalog view. As mentioned previously, when you perform calculations on your spatial data using the **geography** data type, your results will depend on which ellipsoid was used in the creation of your data, as each ellipsoid is assigned a specific spatial reference identifier (SRID).  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] uses the default SRID of 4326, which maps to the WGS 84 spatial reference system, when using methods on **geography** instances. If you use data from a spatial reference system other than WGS 84 (or SRID 4326), you will need to determine the specific SRID for your geography spatial data.  
  
##  <a name="examples"></a> Examples  
 The following examples show how to add and query geography data.  
  
-   The first example creates a table with an identity column and a `geography` column `GeogCol1`. A third column renders the `geography` column into its Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Well-Known Text (WKT) representation, and uses the `STAsText()` method. Two rows are then inserted: one row contains a `LineString` instance of `geography`, and one row contains a `Polygon` instance.  
  
    ```  
    IF OBJECT_ID ( 'dbo.SpatialTable', 'U' ) IS NOT NULL   
        DROP TABLE dbo.SpatialTable;  
    GO  
  
    CREATE TABLE SpatialTable   
        ( id int IDENTITY (1,1),  
        GeogCol1 geography,   
        GeogCol2 AS GeogCol1.STAsText() );  
    GO  
  
    INSERT INTO SpatialTable (GeogCol1)  
    VALUES (geography::STGeomFromText('LINESTRING(-122.360 47.656, -122.343 47.656)', 4326));  
  
    INSERT INTO SpatialTable (GeogCol1)  
    VALUES (geography::STGeomFromText('POLYGON((-122.358 47.653, -122.348 47.649, -122.348 47.658, -122.358 47.658, -122.358 47.653))', 4326));  
    GO  
    ```  
  
-   The second example uses the `STIntersection()` method to return the points where the two previously inserted `geography` instances intersect.  
  
    ```  
    DECLARE @geog1 geography;  
    DECLARE @geog2 geography;  
    DECLARE @result geography;  
  
    SELECT @geog1 = GeogCol1 FROM SpatialTable WHERE id = 1;  
    SELECT @geog2 = GeogCol1 FROM SpatialTable WHERE id = 2;  
    SELECT @result = @geog1.STIntersection(@geog2);  
    SELECT @result.STAsText();  
    ```
