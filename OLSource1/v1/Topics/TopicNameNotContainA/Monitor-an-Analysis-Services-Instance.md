# Monitor an Analysis Services Instance
  You can monitor the performance of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssASnoversion_md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../Token\Other/ssSqlProfiler_md.md)] or Performance Monitor, an application sometimes referred to as **PerfMon**. [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../Token\Other/ssSqlProfiler_md.md)] lets you create and manage traces and analyze and replay trace results. Performance Monitor reports on server status, as indexed through certain counters, which are discussed in the next section.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  For more information about monitoring, see the [SQL Server 2008 R2 Operations Guide](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=225539).
