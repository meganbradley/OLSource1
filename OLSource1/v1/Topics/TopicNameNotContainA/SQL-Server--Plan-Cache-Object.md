# SQL Server, Plan Cache Object
The **Plan Cache** object provides counters to monitor how [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] uses memory to store objects such as stored procedures, ad hoc and prepared [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/tsql_md.md)] statements, and triggers. Multiple instances of the **Plan Cache** object can be monitored at the same time, with each instance representing a different type of plan to monitor.  
  
 This table describes are the **SQLServer:Plan Cache**counters.  
  
|SQL Server Plan Cache counters|Description|  
|------------------------------------|-----------------|  
|**Cache Hit Ratio**|Ratio between cache hits and lookups.|  
|**Cache Object Counts**|Number of cache objects in the cache.|  
|**Cache Pages**|Number of 8-kilobyte (KB) pages used by cache objects.|  
|**Cache Objects in use**|Number of cache objects in use.|  
  
 Each counter in the object contains the following instances:  
  
|Plan Cache instance|Description|  
|-------------------------|-----------------|  
|**_Total**|Information for all types of cache instances.|  
|**Sql Plans**|Query plans produced from an ad hoc [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/tsql_md.md)] query, including auto-parameterized queries, or from [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/tsql_md.md)] statements prepared using **sp_prepare** or **sp_cursorprepare**. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] caches the plans for ad hoc [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/tsql_md.md)] statements for later reuse if the identical [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/tsql_md.md)] statement is later executed. User-parameterized queries (even if not explicitly prepared) are also monitored as Prepared SQL Plans.|  
|**Object Plans**|Query plans generated by creating a stored procedure, function, or trigger.|  
|**Bound Trees**|Normalized trees for views, rules, computed columns, and check constraints.|  
|**Extended Stored Procedures**|Catalog information for extended stores procedures.|  
|**Temporary Tables & Table Variables**|Cache information related to temporary tables and table variables.|
