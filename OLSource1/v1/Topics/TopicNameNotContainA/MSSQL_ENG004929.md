|Symbolic Name||  
|Message Text|Cannot alter the %S_MSG '%.*ls' because it is being published for replication.|  
  
## Explanation  
 This error typically occurs if you attempt to drop the primary key constraint on a table that is published for transactional replication. Transactional replication requires a primary key for each published table; therefore the constraint cannot be dropped.  
  
## User Action  
 To drop the constraint, first drop the article associated with the table. For more information, see [Add Articles to and Drop Articles from Existing Publications](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Add-Articles-to-and-Drop-Articles-from-Existing-Publications.md). If this error occurs in a database that is not replicated, execute [sp_removedbreplication (Transact-SQL)](assetId:///cb98d571-d1eb-467b-91f7-a6e091009672) to ensure objects in the database are not marked as replicated.
