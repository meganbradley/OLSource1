# Power Pivot for SharePoint (SSAS)
An [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] server in [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssGemini_md.md)] mode provides server hosting of [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssGemini_md.md)] data in a SharePoint farm. [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssGemini_md.md)] data is an analytical data model that you build using one of the following:  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssGemini_md.md)] for Excel 2010 add-in  
  
-   Excel 2013  
  
-   Excel 2016  
  
 **[!INCLUDE[applies](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/applies_md.md)]**  [!INCLUDE[ssGeminiShort](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ssGeminiShort_md.md)] 2016 &#124; [!INCLUDE[ssGeminiShort](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ssGeminiShort_md.md)] 2013  
  
 Server hosting of that data requires SharePoint, Excel Services, and an installation of [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssGemini_md.md)] for SharePoint. Data is loaded on [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssGemini_md.md)] for SharePoint instances where it can be refreshed at scheduled intervals using the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssGemini_md.md)] data refresh capability that the server provides for Excel 2010 workbooks, that the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssGemini_md.md)] provides for Excel 2013 and 2016 workbooks.  
  
## Power Pivot for SharePoint 2016  
 [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssGeminiShort](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ssGeminiShort_md.md)] supports [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] SharePoint 2016 and [!INCLUDE[offOnlineServer](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/offOnlineServer_md.md)] usage of Excel workbooks containing data models and [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] Power View reports.  
  
 Excel, within [!INCLUDE[offOnlineServer](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/offOnlineServer_md.md)] includes data model functionality to enable interaction with a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssGemini_md.md)] workbook in the browser. You do not need to deploy the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssGemini_md.md)] for SharePoint 2016 add-in into the farm. You only need to install an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] server in [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssGemini_md.md)] mode and register the server with [!INCLUDE[offOnlineServer](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/offOnlineServer_md.md)].  
  
 Deploying the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssGemini_md.md)] for SharePoint 2016 add-in enables additional functionality and features in your SharePoint farm. The additional features include [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssGemini_md.md)] Gallery and Schedule Data Refresh.

## Power Pivot for SharePoint 2013  
 [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssGeminiShort](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/includes/ssGeminiShort_md.md)] supports [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] SharePoint 2013 Excel Services usage of Excel workbooks containing data models and [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)] Power View reports.  
  
 Excel Services in SharePoint 2013 includes data model functionality to enable interaction with a [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssGemini_md.md)] workbook in the browser. You do not need to deploy the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssGemini_md.md)] for SharePoint 2013 add-in into the farm. You only need to install an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)] server in SharePoint mode and register the server within the Excel Services **Data Model** settings.  
  
 Deploying the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssGemini_md.md)] for SharePoint 2013 add-in enables additional functionality and features in your SharePoint farm. The additional features include [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssGemini_md.md)] Gallery, Schedule Data Refresh, and the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssGemini_md.md)] Management Dashboard.
