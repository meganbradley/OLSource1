# Connect to Existing Secondary Replicas Page (Add Replica Wizard: Add Databases Wizard)
  This help topic describes the options of the **Connect to Existing Secondary Replicas** page. This topic is used by the [!INCLUDE[ssAoAddRepWiz](../../Token\Other/ssAoAddRepWiz_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssAoAddDbWiz](../../Token\Other/ssAoAddDbWiz_md.md)] of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Token\Other/ssCurrent_md.md)].  
  
 **Grid columns:**  
 **Server Instance**  
 Displays the name of the server instance that will host the availability replica.  
  
 **Connected As**  
 Displays the account that is connected to the server instance, once the connection has been established. If this column displays "**Not Connected**" for a given server instance, you will need to click either the **Connect** or **Connect All** button.  
  
 **Connect**  
 Click if this server instance is running under a different account than other server instances to which you need to connect.  
  
 **Connect All**  
 Click only if every instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] to which you need to connect is running as a service in the same user account.  
  
 **Cancel**  
 Click to cancel the wizard. On the **Connect to Existing Secondary Replica** page, cancelling the wizard cause it to exit without performing any actions.
