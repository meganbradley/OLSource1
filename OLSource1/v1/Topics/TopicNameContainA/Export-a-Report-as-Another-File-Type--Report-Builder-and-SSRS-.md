# Export a Report as Another File Type (Report Builder and SSRS)
  You can render a report to another file format, such as CSV, Image, PDF, [!INCLUDE[ofprword](../../Token\Other/ofprword_md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[ofprexcel](../../Token\Other/ofprexcel_md.md)], while previewing your report in Report Builder or Report Designer, or you can render the report while viewing the report on the report server. Rendering the report in a specific format in is helpful when you want to immediately save the report as another file type without publishing the report to the report server or when you want to see how your report design will appear when delivered to your report readers in a specific format. Rendering the report on the report server is useful when you set up subscriptions or deliver your reports via e\-mail, or if you want to save a report that is available on the report server. For more information, seeÂ [Subscriptions and Delivery &#40;Reporting Services&#41;](../Topic/Subscriptions%20and%20Delivery%20\(Reporting%20Services\).md).
