# Add Articles to and Drop Articles from a Publication (SQL Server Management Studio)
  Initially add articles to a publication when you create it in the New Publication Wizard. For more information about using this wizard, see [Create a Publication](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/Create-a-Publication.md).  
  
 After a publication is created, add and delete articles on the **Articles** page of the **Publication Properties \- \<Publication\>** dialog box. For more information about accessing this dialog box, see [View and Modify Publication Properties](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/View-and-Modify-Publication-Properties.md). For information about the considerations for adding and dropping articles, see [Add Articles to and Drop Articles from Existing Publications](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/Add-Articles-to-and-Drop-Articles-from-Existing-Publications.md).

1.  On the **Articles** page of the **Publication Properties \- \<Publication\>** dialog box, clear the **Show only checked objects in the list** check box. This allows you to see the unpublished objects in the publication database.  
  
2.  Select the check box next to each article you want to add.  
  
3.  [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../../Token\Other/clickOK_md.md)]
