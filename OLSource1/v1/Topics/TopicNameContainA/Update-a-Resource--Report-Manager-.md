# Update a Resource (Report Manager)
You can update a resource by replacing it with a newer version. Resources are items stored on a report server that contain content from a file that you upload. You can replace an existing resource by importing new or different file content into the existing resource. Updating a resource provides a way to update content while preserving existing properties and security settings on the resource.  
  
### To update a resource  
  
1.  Start [Report Manager  (SSRS Native Mode)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Report-Manager---SSRS-Native-Mode-.md).  
  
2.  In Report Manager, navigate to or search for the resource you want to update.  
  
3.  Click the resource to open it in the **View** page.  
  
4.  Click **Properties** to open the **General** properties page.  
  
5.  Click **Replace** to open the **Import Resource** page.  
  
6.  Click **Browse**.  
  
7.  Select the file that you want to use to replace the current resource. You can use an updated version of the resource file, or specify a file with a different name or file type.  
  
8.  Click **OK** to upload the resource file, close the **Import Resource** page, and save your changes to the report server.  
  
 If the resource you are updating contains an image that is used in a report, you need to refresh the report to see the updated image.
