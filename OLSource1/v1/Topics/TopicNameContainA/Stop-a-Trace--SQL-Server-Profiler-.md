# Stop a Trace (SQL Server Profiler)
This topic describes how to stop a trace that is running by using [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSqlProfiler_md.md)].  
  
 Stopping a trace stops data from being captured. After a trace is stopped, it cannot be restarted without losing previously captured data, unless the data has been captured to a trace file or trace table. You can also save the collected data to a table or file after stopping a trace. All trace properties that were previously selected are preserved when a trace is stopped. When a trace is stopped, you can change the name, events, columns, and filters.  
  
### To stop a trace  
  
1.  Select a trace that is running.  
  
2.  On the **File** menu, click **Stop Trace**.
