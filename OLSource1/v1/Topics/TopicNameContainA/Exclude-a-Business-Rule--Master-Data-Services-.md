# Exclude a Business Rule (Master Data Services)
In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)], exclude a business rule when you do not want to delete the rule permanently, but you do not want to validate data against it.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have permission to access the **System Administration** functional area.  
  
-   You must be a model administrator. For more information, see [Administrators (Master Data Services)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Administrators--Master-Data-Services-.md).

2.  From the menu bar, point to **Manage** and click **Business Rules**.  
  
3.  On the **Business Rules** page, from the **Model** drop-down list, select a model.  
  
4.  From the **Entity** drop-down list, select an entity.  
  
5.  From the **Member Types** drop-down list, select a type of member.  
  
6.  In the grid, select the row for the business rule you want to exclude and click **Edit**.
