# Stopping System-Versioning on a System-Versioned Temporal Table
You may want to stop versioning on your temporal table either temporarily or permanently.   
You can do that by setting **SYSTEM_VERSIONING** clause to **OFF**.  
  
## Setting SYSTEM_VERSIONING = OFF  
 Stop system-versioning if you want to perform specific maintenance operations on temporal table or if you don’t need a versioned table anymore. As a result of this operation you will get two independent tables:  
  
-   Current table with period definition  
  
-   History table as a regular table  
  
### Important remarks  
  
-   No data loss happens when you set  **SYSTEM_VERSIONING = OFF** or drop the **SYSTEM_TIME** period.  
  
-   When you set **SYSTEM_VERSIONING = OFF** and do not remove drop the **SYSTEM_TIME** period, the system will continue to update the period columns for every insert and update operation. Deletes on current table will be permanent.  
  
-   Drop the **SYSTEM_TIME** period to remove the period columns completely.  
  
-   When you set **SYSTEM_VERSIONING = OFF**, all users that have sufficient permissions will be able to modify schema and content of history table or even to permanently delete the history table.  
  
-   Prior to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrentLong](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrentLong_md.md)], changing the schema of a temporal table required you to set **SYSTEM_VERSIONING = OFF**. However, beginning with  [!INCLUDE[ssCurrentLong](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrentLong_md.md)], you can now add, drop or alter temporal table columns without changing system-versioning state.  
  
### Permanently remove SYSTEM_VERSIONING  
 This example permanently removes SYSTEM_VERSIONING and removes the period columns completely. Removing the period columns is optional.  
  
```  
ALTER TABLE dbo.Department SET (SYSTEM_VERSIONING = OFF);   
/*Optionally, DROP PERIOD if you want to revert temporal table to a non-temporal*/   
ALTER TABLE dbo.Department   
DROP PERIOD FOR SYSTEM_TIME;  
  
```  
  
### Temporarily remove SYSTEM_VERSIONING  
 This is the list of operations that requires system-versioning to be set to **OFF**:  
  
-   Removing unnecessary data from history (**DELETE** or **TRUNCATE**)  
  
-   Removing data from current table without versioning (**DELETE**, **TRUNCATE**)  
  
-   Partition **SWITCH OUT** from current table  
  
-   Partition **SWITCH IN** into history table  
  
 This example temporarily stops SYSTEM_VERSIONING to allow you to perform specific maintenance operations. If you stop versioning temporarily as a prerequisite for table maintenance, we strongly recommend doing this inside a transaction to keep data consistency.  
  
```  
BEGIN TRAN   
ALTER TABLE dbo.Department SET (SYSTEM_VERSIONING = OFF);   
TRUNCATE TABLE [History].[DepartmentHistory]   
WITH (PARTITIONS (1,2))   
ALTER TABLE dbo.Department SET    
(   
SYSTEM_VERSIONING = ON (HISTORY_TABLE = History.DepartmentHistory)   
);   
COMMIT ;  
  
```
