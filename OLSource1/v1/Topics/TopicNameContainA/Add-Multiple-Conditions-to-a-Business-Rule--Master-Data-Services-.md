# Add Multiple Conditions to a Business Rule (Master Data Services)
In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)], add multiple **AND** or **OR** conditions to a business rule when you want a more complex rule.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you create a business rule that uses the **OR** operator, consider creating a separate rule for each conditional statement that can be evaluated independently. You can then exclude rules as needed, providing more flexibility and easier troubleshooting.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have permission to access the **System Administration** functional area.  
  
-   You must be a model administrator. For more information, see [Administrators (Master Data Services)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Administrators--Master-Data-Services-.md).  
  
-   A business rule must exist. For more information, see [Create and Publish a Business Rule (Master Data Services)](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Create-and-Publish-a-Business-Rule--Master-Data-Services-.md).

1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSmdm_md.md)], click **System Administration**.

5.  From the **Member Types** drop-down list, select a type of member.  
  
6.  Click the row for the business rule you want to edit.  
  
7.  Click **Edit**.  
  
8.  Under the **If** block, on the left side from the logical operator drop-down list select **AND/OR/ NOT**.  
  
9. Click **Add**. A panel will be displayed.  
  
10. From the **Attribute** drop-down list, select an attribute.

    > [!TIP]  
    >  To delete a condition, select the condition and right-click on it and click **Delete**.  
  
    > [!TIP]  
    >  You can select multiple conditions and right-click to group them inside a logical operator, or to ungroup conditions inside a specific logical operator.
