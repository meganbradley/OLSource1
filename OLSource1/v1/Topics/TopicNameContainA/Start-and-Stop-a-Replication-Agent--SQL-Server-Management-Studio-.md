# Start and Stop a Replication Agent (SQL Server Management Studio)
Start and stop agents from the **Jobs** folder and the **Replication** folder in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] and from Replication Monitor. Start and stop the following agents and jobs:  
  
-   The Snapshot Agent, which is used by all publications.  
  
-   The Log Reader Agent, which is used by all transactional publications.  
  
-   The Queue Reader Agent, which is used by transactional publications enabled for queued updating subscriptions.  
  
-   The Distribution Agent, which synchronizes subscriptions to transactional and snapshot publications.  
  
-   The Merge Agent, which synchronizes subscriptions to merge publications.  
  
-   Replication maintenance jobs.  
  
 For more information about starting the Merge Agent and the Distribution Agent, see [Synchronize a Push Subscription](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Synchronize-a-Push-Subscription.md) and [Synchronize a Pull Subscription](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Synchronize-a-Pull-Subscription.md). For more information about maintenance jobs, see [Run Replication Maintenance Jobs (SQL Server Management Studio)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Run-Replication-Maintenance-Jobs--SQL-Server-Management-Studio-.md).  
  
 For information about starting Replication Monitor, see [Start the Replication Monitor](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Start-the-Replication-Monitor.md).
