# Add, Delete, Change Scope of User-Defined Variable in a Package
These procedures describe how to add, delete, and change the scope of a user-defined variable in a package by using the **Variables** window.  
  
 For more information about variable scope, see [Integration Services (SSIS) Variables](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Integration-Services--SSIS--Variables.md).  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] also provides system variables that make system information available at run time and can be used in containers such as packages and event handlers. You cannot delete system variables.  
  
### To add a variable  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)], open the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] package you want to work with.  
  
2.  In Solution Explorer, double-click the package to open it.  
  
3.  In [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssIS_md.md)] Designer, to define the scope of the variable, do one of the following:  
  
    -   To set the scope to the package, click anywhere on the design surface of the **Control Flow** tab.  
  
    -   To set the scope to an event handler, select an executable and an event handler on the design surface of the **Event Handler** tab.  
  
    -   To set the scope to a task or container, on the design surface of the **Control Flow** tab or the **Event Handler** tab, click a task or container.  
  
4.  On the **SSIS** menu, click **Variables**. You can optionally display the **Variables** window by mapping the View.Variables command to a key combination of your choosing on the **Keyboard** page of the **Options** dialog box.  
  
5.  In the **Variables** window, click the **Add Variable** icon. The new variable is added to the list.  
  
6.  Optionally, click the **Grid Options** icon, select additional columns to show in the **Variables Grid Options** dialog box, and then click **OK**.  
  
7.  Optionally, set the variable properties. For more information, see [Set the Properties of a User-Defined Variable](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Set-the-Properties-of-a-User-Defined-Variable.md).  
  
8.  To save the updated package, click **Save Selected Items** on the **File** menu.  
  
### To delete a variable  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)], open the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] project that contains the package you want.  
  
2.  In Solution Explorer, right-click the package to open it.  
  
3.  On the **SSIS** menu, click **Variables**. You can optionally display the **Variables** window by mapping the View.Variables command to a key combination of your choosing on the **Keyboard** page of the **Options** dialog box.  
  
4.  Select the variable to delete, and then click **Delete Variable**.  
  
     If you don’t see the variable in the Variables window, click **Grid Options** and then select **Show variables of all scopes**.  
  
5.  If the **Confirm Deletion of Variables** dialog box opens, click **Yes** to confirm.  
  
6.  To save the updated package, click **Save Selected Items** on the **File** menu.  
  
### To change the scope of a variable  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)], open the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] project that contains the package you want.  
  
2.  In Solution Explorer, right-click the package to open it.  
  
3.  On the **SSIS** menu, click **Variables**. You can optionally display the **Variables** window by mapping the View.Variables command to a key combination of your choosing on the **Keyboard** page of the **Options** dialog box.  
  
4.  Select the variable and then click **Move Variable**.  
  
     If you don’t see the variable in the Variables window, click **Grid Options** and then select **Show variables of all scopes**.  
  
5.  In the **Select New Scope** dialog box, select the package or a container, task, or event handler in the package, to change the variable scope.  
  
6.  To save the updated package, click **Save Selected Items** on the **File** menu.
