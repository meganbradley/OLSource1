# Publish the Execution of a Stored Procedure in a Transactional Publication (SQL Server Management Studio)
Specify that the execution of a stored procedure (rather than just its definition) should be published in the **Article Properties - <Article\>** dialog box. This dialog box is available in the New Publication Wizard and the **Publication Properties - <Publication\>** dialog box. For more information about using the wizard and accessing the dialog box, see [Create a Publication](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Create-a-Publication.md) and [View and Modify Publication Properties](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/View-and-Modify-Publication-Properties.md).  
  
 The definition of the procedure (the CREATE PROCEDURE statement) is replicated to the Subscriber when the subscription is initialized; when the procedure is executed at the Publisher, replication executes the corresponding procedure at the Subscriber.  
  
### To publish the execution of a stored procedure  
  
1.  On the **Articles** page of the New Publication Wizard or the **Publication Properties - <Publication\>** dialog box, select a stored procedure.  
  
2.  Click **Article Properties**, and then click **Set Properties of Highlighted Stored Procedure**.  
  
3.  In the **Article Properties - <Article\>** dialog box, specify one of the following values for the **Replicate** option:  
  
    -   **Execution of the stored procedure**  
  
    -   **Execution in a serialized transaction of the SP**  
  
         This is the recommended option, because it replicates the procedure execution only if the procedure is executed within the context of a serializable transaction. If the stored procedure is executed outside of a serializable transaction, changes to data in published tables are replicated as a series of data manipulation language (DML) statements.  
  
4.  [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/clickOK_md.md)]  
  
5.  If you are in the **Publication Properties - <Publication\>** dialog box, click **OK** to save and close the dialog box.
