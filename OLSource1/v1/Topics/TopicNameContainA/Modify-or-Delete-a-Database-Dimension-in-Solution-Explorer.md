# Modify or Delete a Database Dimension in Solution Explorer
  You can modify or delete a dimension by using Dimension Designer in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)]. When you modify a dimension, your changes are not available to users until you process the dimension. For more information, see [Processing a multidimensional model &#40;Analysis Services&#41;](../Topic/Processing%20a%20multidimensional%20model%20\(Analysis%20Services\).md).  
  
### To modify a dimension in SQL Server Data Tools  
  
1.  In Solution Explorer, right\-click the dimension that you want to modify, and then click **Open**.  
  
2.  On the **Dimension Structure** tab, in the **Attributes**, **Hierarchies**, or **Data Source View** panes, click the item that you want to modify, and then make the changes.  
  
     For more information about the types of changes that you can make, see [Processing a multidimensional model &#40;Analysis Services&#41;](../Topic/Processing%20a%20multidimensional%20model%20\(Analysis%20Services\).md).
