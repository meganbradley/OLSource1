# Correlate a Trace with Windows Performance Log Data
Using [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSqlProfiler_md.md)], you can open a Microsoft Windows performance log, choose the counters you want to correlate with a trace, and display the selected performance counters alongside the trace in the [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSqlProfiler_md.md)] graphical user interface. When you select an event in the trace window, a vertical red bar in the System Monitor data window pane of [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSqlProfiler_md.md)] indicates the performance log data that correlates with the selected trace event.  
  
 To correlate a trace with performance counters, open a trace file or table that contains the **StartTime** and **EndTime** data columns, and then click **Import Performance Data** on the [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSqlProfiler_md.md)] **File** menu. You can then open a performance log, and select the System Monitor objects and counters that you want to correlate with the trace.
