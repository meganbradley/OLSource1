# Building a Model (MDS Add-in for Excel)
In the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssMDSXLS](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSXLS_md.md)], administrators can perform a subset of the administrative functions available in the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSmdm_md.md)] web application.  
  
 The model building tasks administrators can do in the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssMDSXLS](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSXLS_md.md)] are:  
  
-   Create entities. For more information about entities, see [Entities (Master Data Services)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Entities--Master-Data-Services-.md).  
  
-   Create attributes of all types, including domain-based attributes. For more information about attributes, see [Attributes (Master Data Services)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Attributes--Master-Data-Services-.md) and [Domain-Based Attributes (Master Data Services)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Domain-Based-Attributes--Master-Data-Services-.md).  
  
 As an administrator, you must create the model by using the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSmdm_md.md)] web application or the web service. Then you can use the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSXLS](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSXLS_md.md)] to create entities and attributes within the model. For more information about model objects, see [Models (Master Data Services)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Models--Master-Data-Services-.md).  
  
## Related Tasks  
 Most administrative tasks must still be done in the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSmdm_md.md)] web application or by using the web service. The following table shows which tools administrators can use to complete tasks in MDS.
