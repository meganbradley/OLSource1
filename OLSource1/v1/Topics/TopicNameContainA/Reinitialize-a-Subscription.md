# Reinitialize a Subscription
  This topic describes how to reinitialize a subscription in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Token\Other/ssCurrent_md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssManStudioFull_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Token\Other/tsql_md.md)], or Replication Management Objects \(RMO\). Individual subscriptions can be marked for reinitialization so that a new snapshot is applied during the next synchronization.  
  
 **In This Topic**  
  
-   **To reinitialize a subscription, using:**  
  
     [SQL Server Management Studio](#SSMSProcedure)  
  
     [Transact\-SQL](#TsqlProcedure)  
  
     [Replication Management Objects \(RMO\)](#RMOProcedure)  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio  
 Reinitializing a subscription is a two\-part process:  
  
1.  A single subscription or all subscriptions to a publication are *marked* for reinitialization. Mark subscriptions for reinitialization in the **Reinitialize Subscription\(s\)** dialog box, which is available from the **Local Publications** folder and the **Local Subscriptions** folder in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Token\Other/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssManStudioFull_md.md)]. You can also mark subscriptions from the **All Subscriptions** tab and the publications node in Replication Monitor. For information about starting Replication Monitor, see [Start the Replication Monitor](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/Start-the-Replication-Monitor.md). When you mark a subscription for reinitialization, you have the following options:  
  
     **Use the current snapshot**  
     Select to apply the current snapshot to the Subscriber the next time the Distribution Agent or Merge Agent runs. If there is no valid snapshot available, this option cannot be selected.  
  
     **Use a new snapshot**  
     Select to reinitialize the subscription with a new snapshot. The snapshot can be applied to the Subscriber only after it has been generated by the Snapshot Agent. If the Snapshot Agent is set to run on a schedule, the subscription is not reinitialized until after the next scheduled Snapshot Agent run. Select **Generate the new snapshot now** to start the Snapshot Agent immediately.  
  
     **Upload unsynchronized changes before reinitialization**  
     Merge replication only. Select to upload any pending changes from the subscription database before the data at the Subscriber is overwritten with a snapshot.  
  
     If you add, drop, or change a parameterized filter, pending changes at the Subscriber cannot be uploaded to the Publisher during reinitialization. If you want to upload pending changes, synchronize all subscriptions before changing the filter.  
  
2.  A subscription is reinitialized the next time it is synchronized: the Distribution Agent \(for transactional replication\) or Merge Agent \(for merge replication\) applies the most recent snapshot to each Subscriber that has a subscription marked for reinitialization. For more information about synchronizing subscriptions, see [Synchronize a Push Subscription](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/Synchronize-a-Push-Subscription.md) and [Synchronize a Pull Subscription](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/Synchronize-a-Pull-Subscription.md).  
  
#### To mark a single push or pull subscription for reinitialization in Management Studio \(at the Publisher\)  
  
1.  Connect to the Publisher in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../Token\Other/ssManStudio_md.md)], and then expand the server node.  
  
2.  Expand the **Replication** folder, and then expand the **Local Publications** folder.  
  
3.  Expand the publication that has the subscription you want to reinitialize.  
  
4.  Right\-click the subscription, and then click **Reinitialize**.  
  
5.  In the **Reinitialize Subscription\(s\)** dialog box, select options, and then click **Mark for Reinitialization**.  
  
#### To mark a single pull subscription for reinitialization in Management Studio \(at the Subscriber\)  
  
1.  Connect to the Subscriber in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../Token\Other/ssManStudio_md.md)], and then expand the server node.  
  
2.  Expand the **Replication** folder, and then expand the **Local Subscriptions** folder.  
  
3.  Right\-click the subscription, and then click **Reinitialize**.  
  
4.  In the confirmation dialog box that is displayed, click **Yes**.  
  
#### To mark all subscriptions for reinitialization in Management Studio  
  
1.  Connect to the Publisher in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../Token\Other/ssManStudio_md.md)], and then expand the server node.  
  
2.  Expand the **Replication** folder, and then expand the **Local Publications** folder.  
  
3.  Right\-click the publication with subscriptions you want to reinitialize, and then click **Reinitialize All Subscriptions**.  
  
4.  In the **Reinitialize Subscription\(s\)** dialog box, select options, and then click **Mark for Reinitialization**.  
  
#### To mark a single push or pull subscription for reinitialization in Replication Monitor  
  
1.  In Replication Monitor, expand a Publisher group in the left pane, expand a Publisher, and then click a publication.  
  
2.  Click the **All Subscriptions** tab.  
  
3.  Right\-click the subscription you want to reinitialize, and then click **Reinitialize Subscription**.  
  
4.  In the **Reinitialize Subscription\(s\)** dialog box, select options, and then click **Mark for Reinitialization**.  
  
#### To mark all subscriptions for reinitialization in Replication Monitor  
  
1.  In Replication Monitor, expand a Publisher group in the left pane, and then expand a Publisher.  
  
2.  Right\-click the publication with subscriptions you want to reinitialize, and then click **Reinitialize All Subscriptions**.  
  
3.  In the **Reinitialize Subscription\(s\)** dialog box, select options, and then click **Mark for Reinitialization**.  
  
##  <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a> Using Transact\-SQL  
 Subscriptions can be reinitialized programmatically using replication stored procedures. The stored procedure that is used depends on the type of subscription \(push or pull\) and the type of publication to which the subscription belongs.  
  
#### To reinitialize a pull subscription to a transactional publication  
  
1.  At the Subscriber on the subscription database, execute [sp_reinitpullsubscription &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../Topic/sp_reinitpullsubscription%20\(Transact-SQL\).md). Specify **@publisher**, **@publisher\_db**, and **@publication**. This marks the subscription for reinitialization the next time the Distribution Agent runs.  
  
2.  \(Optional\) Start the Distribution Agent at the Subscriber to synchronize the subscription. For more information, see [Synchronize a Pull Subscription](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/Synchronize-a-Pull-Subscription.md).  
  
#### To reinitialize a push subscription to a transactional publication  
  
1.  At the Publisher, execute [sp_reinitsubscription &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../Topic/sp_reinitsubscription%20\(Transact-SQL\).md). Specify **@publication**, **@subscriber**, and **@destination\_db**. This marks the subscription for reinitialization the next time the Distribution Agent runs.  
  
2.  \(Optional\) Start the Distribution Agent at the Distributor to synchronize the subscription. For more information, see [Synchronize a Push Subscription](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/Synchronize-a-Push-Subscription.md).  
  
#### To reinitialize a pull subscription to a merge publication  
  
1.  At the Subscriber on the subscription database, execute [sp_reinitmergepullsubscription &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../Topic/sp_reinitmergepullsubscription%20\(Transact-SQL\).md). Specify **@publisher**, **@publisher\_db**, and **@publication**. To upload changes from the Subscriber before reinitialization occurs, specify a value of **true** for **@upload\_first**. This marks the subscription for reinitialization the next time the Merge Agent runs.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  If you add, drop, or change a parameterized filter, pending changes at the Subscriber cannot be uploaded to the Publisher during reinitialization. If you want to upload pending changes, synchronize all subscriptions before changing the filter.  
  
2.  \(Optional\) Start the Merge Agent at the Subscriber to synchronize the subscription. For more information, see [Synchronize a Pull Subscription](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/Synchronize-a-Pull-Subscription.md).  
  
#### To reinitialize a push subscription to a merge publication  
  
1.  At the Publisher, execute [sp_reinitmergesubscription &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../Topic/sp_reinitmergesubscription%20\(Transact-SQL\).md). Specify **@publication**, **@subscriber**, and **@subscriber\_db**. To upload changes from the Subscriber before reinitialization occurs, specify a value of **true** for **@upload\_first**. This marks the subscription for reinitialization the next time the Distribution Agent runs.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  If you add, drop, or change a parameterized filter, pending changes at the Subscriber cannot be uploaded to the Publisher during reinitialization. If you want to upload pending changes, synchronize all subscriptions before changing the filter.  
  
2.  \(Optional\) Start the Merge Agent at the Distributor to synchronize the subscription. For more information, see [Synchronize a Push Subscription](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/Synchronize-a-Push-Subscription.md).  
  
#### To set the reinitialization policy when creating a new merge publication  
  
1.  At the Publisher on the publication database, execute [sp\_addmergepublication](../Topic/sp_addmergepublication%20\(Transact-SQL\).md), specifying one of the following values for **@automatic\_reinitialization\_policy**:  
  
    -   **1** \- changes are uploaded from the Subscriber before a subscription is automatically reinitialized as required by a change to the publication.  
  
    -   **0** \- changes at the Subscriber are discarded when a subscription is automatically reinitialized as required by a change to the publication.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  If you add, drop, or change a parameterized filter, pending changes at the Subscriber cannot be uploaded to the Publisher during reinitialization. If you want to upload pending changes, synchronize all subscriptions before changing the filter.  
  
     For more information, see [Create a Publication](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/Create-a-Publication.md).  
  
#### To change the reinitialization policy for an existing merge publication  
  
1.  At the Publisher on the publication database, execute [sp\_changemergepublication](../Topic/sp_changemergepublication%20\(Transact-SQL\).md), specifying **automatic\_reinitialization\_policy** for **@property** and one of the following values for **@value**:  
  
    -   **1** \- changes are uploaded from the Subscriber before a subscription is automatically reinitialized as required by a change to the publication.  
  
    -   **0** \- changes at the Subscriber are discarded when a subscription is automatically reinitialized as required by a change to the publication.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  If you add, drop, or change a parameterized filter, pending changes at the Subscriber cannot be uploaded to the Publisher during reinitialization. If you want to upload pending changes, synchronize all subscriptions before changing the filter.  
  
     For more information, see [View and Modify Publication Properties](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/View-and-Modify-Publication-Properties.md).  
  
##  <a name="RMOProcedure"></a> Using Replication Management Objects \(RMO\)  
 Individual subscriptions can be marked for reinitialization so that during the next synchronization, a new snapshot is applied. Subscriptions can be reinitialized programmatically by using Replication Management Objects \(RMO\). The classes you use depend on the type of publication to which the subscription belongs and the type of subscription \(that is, a push or pull subscription\).  
  
#### To reinitialize a pull subscription to a transactional publication  
  
1.  Create a connection to the Subscriber by using the [ServerConnection](assetId:///T:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ServerConnection) class.  
  
2.  Create an instance of the [TransPullSubscription](assetId:///T:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.TransPullSubscription) class, and set [PublicationName](assetId:///P:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.PullSubscription.PublicationName), [DatabaseName](assetId:///P:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.PullSubscription.DatabaseName), [PublisherName](assetId:///P:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.PullSubscription.PublisherName), [PublicationDBName](assetId:///P:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.PullSubscription.PublicationDBName), and the connection from step 1 for [ConnectionContext](assetId:///P:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.ReplicationObject.ConnectionContext).  
  
3.  Call the [LoadProperties](assetId:///M:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.ReplicationObject.LoadProperties) method to get the properties of the object.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If this method returns **false**, either the subscription properties in step 2 were defined incorrectly or the pull subscription does not exist.  
  
4.  Call the [Reinitialize](assetId:///M:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.TransPullSubscription.Reinitialize) method. This method marks the subscription for reinitialization.  
  
5.  Synchronize the pull subscription. For more information, see [Synchronize a Pull Subscription](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/Synchronize-a-Pull-Subscription.md).  
  
#### To reinitialize a push subscription to a transactional publication  
  
1.  Create a connection to the Publisher by using the [ServerConnection](assetId:///T:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ServerConnection) class.  
  
2.  Create an instance of the [TransSubscription](assetId:///T:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.TransSubscription) class, and set [PublicationName](assetId:///P:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.Subscription.PublicationName), [DatabaseName](assetId:///P:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.Subscription.DatabaseName), [SubscriberName](assetId:///P:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.Subscription.SubscriberName), [SubscriptionDBName](assetId:///P:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.Subscription.SubscriptionDBName), and the connection from step 1 for [ConnectionContext](assetId:///P:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.ReplicationObject.ConnectionContext).  
  
3.  Call the [LoadProperties](assetId:///M:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.ReplicationObject.LoadProperties) method to get the properties of the object.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If this method returns **false**, either the subscription properties in step 2 were defined incorrectly or the push subscription does not exist.  
  
4.  Call the [Reinitialize](assetId:///M:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.TransSubscription.Reinitialize) method. This method marks the subscription for reinitialization.  
  
5.  Synchronize the push subscription. For more information, see [Synchronize a Push Subscription](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/Synchronize-a-Push-Subscription.md).  
  
#### To reinitialize a pull subscription to a merge publication  
  
1.  Create a connection to the Subscriber by using the [ServerConnection](assetId:///T:Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Common.ServerConnection) class.  
  
2.  Create an instance of the [MergePullSubscription](assetId:///T:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.MergePullSubscription) class, and set [PublicationName](assetId:///P:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.PullSubscription.PublicationName), [DatabaseName](assetId:///P:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.PullSubscription.DatabaseName), [PublisherName](assetId:///P:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.PullSubscription.PublisherName), [PublicationDBName](assetId:///P:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.PullSubscription.PublicationDBName), and the connection from step 1 for [ConnectionContext](assetId:///P:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.ReplicationObject.ConnectionContext).  
  
3.  Call the [LoadProperties](assetId:///M:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.ReplicationObject.LoadProperties) method to get the properties of the object.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If this method returns **false**, either the subscription properties in step 2 were defined incorrectly or the pull subscription does not exist.  
  
4.  Call the [Reinitialize](assetId:///M:Microsoft.SqlServer.Replication.MergePullSubscription.Reinitialize(System.Boolean)) method. Pass a value of **true** to upload changes at the Subscriber before reinitialization or a value of **false** to reinitialize and lose any pending changes at the Subscriber. This method marks the subscription for reinitialization.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Changes cannot be uploaded if the subscription is expired. For more information, see [Set the Expiration Period for Subscriptions](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/Set-the-Expiration-Period-for-Subscriptions.md).  
  
5.  Synchronize the pull subscription. For more information, see [Synchronize a Pull Subscription](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/Synchronize-a-Pull-Subscription.md).
