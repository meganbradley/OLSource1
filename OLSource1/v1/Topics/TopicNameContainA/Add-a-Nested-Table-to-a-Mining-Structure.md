# Add a Nested Table to a Mining Structure
  Use Data Mining Designer to add a nested table to a mining structure after it has been created by the Data Mining Wizard.  
  
### To add a nested table to a mining structure  
  
1.  Select the **Mining Structure** tab in Data Mining Designer.  
  
2.  Right\-click the mining structure to which you want to add a table column.  
  
3.  Select **Add a Nested Table**.  
  
     The **Select a Nested Table Key Column** dialog box opens.  
  
4.  Under **Nested table**, select the table that you want to nest in the mining structure.  
  
5.  Under **Source column**, select the key column for the nested table.  
  
6.  Click **OK**.  
  
     A new table column that contains the key column is added to the mining structure. For information about how to add additional columns, see [Add Columns to a Mining Structure](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/Add-Columns-to-a-Mining-Structure.md).
