# Rename a Stored Procedure
This topic describes how to rename a stored procedure in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/tsql_md.md)].

##  <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before You Begin  
  
###  <a name="Restrictions"></a> Limitations and Restrictions  
  
-   Procedure names must comply with the rules for [identifiers](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Database-Identifiers.md).  
  
-   Renaming a stored procedure will not change the name of the corresponding object name in the definition column of the **sys.sql_modules** catalog view. Therefore, we recommend that you do not rename this object type. Instead, drop and re-create the stored procedure with its new name.  
  
-   Changing the name or definition of a procedure can cause dependent objects to fail when the objects are not updated to reflect the changes that have been made to the procedure. For more information, see [View the Dependencies of a Stored Procedure](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/View-the-Dependencies-of-a-Stored-Procedure.md).  
  
###  <a name="Security"></a> Security  
  
####  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 CREATE PROCEDURE  
 Requires CREATE PROCEDURE permission in the database and ALTER permission on the schema in which the procedure is being created, or requires membership in the **db_ddladmin** fixed database role.  
  
 ALTER PROCEDURE  
 Requires ALTER permission on the procedure or requires membership in the **db_ddladmin** fixed database role.  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio  
  
#### To rename a stored procedure  
  
1.  In Object Explorer, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)] and then expand that instance.  
  
2.  Expand **Databases**, expand the database in which the procedure belongs, and then expand **Programmability**.  
  
3.  [Determine the dependencies of the stored procedure](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/View-the-Dependencies-of-a-Stored-Procedure.md).  
  
4.  Expand **Stored Procedures**, right-click the procedure to rename, and then click **Rename**.  
  
5.  Modify the procedure name.  
  
6.  Modify the procedure name referenced in any dependent objects or scripts.  
  
##  <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a> Using Transact-SQL  
  
#### To rename a stored procedure  
  
1.  Connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)].  
  
2.  From the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**. This example shows how to rename a procedure by dropping the procedure and re-creating the procedure with a new name. The first example creates the stored procedure `'HumanResources.uspGetAllEmployeesTest`. The second example renames the stored procedure to `HumanResources.uspEveryEmployeeTest`.  
  
```tsql  
--Create the stored procedure.  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GO  
IF OBJECT_ID ( 'HumanResources.uspGetAllEmployeesTest', 'P' ) IS NOT NULL   
    DROP PROCEDURE HumanResources.uspGetAllEmployeesTest;  
GO  
CREATE PROCEDURE HumanResources.uspGetAllEmployeesTest  
AS  
    SET NOCOUNT ON;  
    SELECT LastName, FirstName, Department  
    FROM HumanResources.vEmployeeDepartmentHistory;  
GO  
  
--Rename the stored procedure.  
USE AdventureWorks2012;  
GO  
IF OBJECT_ID ( 'HumanResources.uspGetAllEmployeesTest', 'P' ) IS NOT NULL   
    DROP PROCEDURE HumanResources.uspGetAllEmployeesTest;  
GO  
CREATE PROCEDURE HumanResources.uspEveryEmployeeTest  
AS  
    SET NOCOUNT ON;  
    SELECT LastName, FirstName, Department  
    FROM HumanResources.vEmployeeDepartmentHistory;  
GO  
```
