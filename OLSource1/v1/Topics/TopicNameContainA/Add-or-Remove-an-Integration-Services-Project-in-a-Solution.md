# Add or Remove an Integration Services Project in a Solution
The following procedures descibe how to add or remove an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] project in a solution.  
  
 You can only add a project to an existing solution, or remove a project from a solution, when the solution is visible in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)]. If you have selected the **Always show solution** option in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)] will display a solution even when that solution contains only one project. Otherwise, [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)] will display a solution only when that solution contains more than one project. The additional projects can be either [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssIS_md.md)] projects or projects of other types.  
  
## Adding an Integration Services Project  
 When you add a project, you can have [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] create a new, blank project, or you can add a project that you have already created for a different solution. You can only add a project to an existing solution when the solution is visible in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)].  
  
#### To add a new Integration Services project to a solution  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)], open the solution to which you want to add a new [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] project, and do one of the following:  
  
    -   Right-click the solution, click **Add**, and then click **New Project**.  
  
    -   On the **File** menu, point to **Add**, and then click **New Project**.  
  
2.  In the **Add New Project** dialog box, click **Integration Services Project** in the **Templates** pane.  
  
3.  Optionally, edit the project name and location.  
  
4.  Click **OK**.  
  
#### To add an existing Integration Services project to a solution  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)], open the solution to which you want to add an existing [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] project, and do one of the following:  
  
    -   Right-click the solution, point to **Add**, and then click **Existing Project**.  
  
    -   On the **File** menu, click **Add**, and then click **Existing Project**.  
  
2.  In the **Add Existing Project** dialog box, browse to locate the project you want to add, and then click **Open**.  
  
3.  The project is added to the solution folder in **Solution Explorer**.  
  
## Removing an Integration Services Project  
 You can only remove a project from a solution when the solution is visible in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)]. After the solution is visible, you can remove all except one project. As soon as only one project remains, [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)] no longer displays the solution folder and you cannot remove the last project.  
  
#### To remove an Integration Services project from a solution  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)], open the solution from which you want to remove an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] project.  
  
2.  In Solution Explorer, right-click the project, and then click **Unload Project**.  
  
3.  Click **OK** to confirm the removal.
