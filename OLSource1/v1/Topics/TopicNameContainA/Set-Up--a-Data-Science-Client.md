# Set Up  a Data Science Client
  After you have configured an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Token\Other/ssCurrent_md.md)] by installing **R Services \(In\-Database\)**, you'll want to set up an R development environment that is capable of connecting to the server for remote execution and deployment. The client should include Microsoft R Open, as well as the additional RevoScaleR packages that support distributed execution of R on SQL Server.  
  
 You can do this by installing Microsoft R Client (available for release soon).
 
 For more information and the download location, see the [Microsoft R Server](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=799768) page in the MSDN library.  
 
  
 For a walkthrough of how to connect to a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] instance for remote execution of R code, see this tutorial: [Data Science Deep Dive: Using the RevoScaleR Packages](../Topic/Data%20Science%20Deep%20Dive:%20Using%20the%20RevoScaleR%20Packages.md).
