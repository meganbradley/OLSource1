# Move a UCP from One Instance of SQL Server to Another (SQL Server Utility)
This topic describes how to move a utility control point (UCP) from one instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] to another in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)].  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio  
  
#### Move a UCP from one instance of SQL Server to another.  
  
1.  Create a new UCP on the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] that will be the new host instance of the UCP. For more information, see [Create a SQL Server Utility Control Point (SQL Server Utility)](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Create-a-SQL-Server-Utility-Control-Point--SQL-Server-Utility-.md).  
  
2.  If non-default policy settings have been set for any instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] in your [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Utility, make note of the policy thresholds so that you can re-establish them on the new UCP. Default policies are applied when instances are added to the new UCP. If default policies are in effect, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Utility list view displays **Global** in the **Policy Type** column.  
  
3.  Remove all managed instances from the old UCP. For more information, see [Remove an Instance of SQL Server from the SQL Server Utility](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Remove-an-Instance-of-SQL-Server-from-the-SQL-Server-Utility.md).  
  
4.  Back up the utility management data warehouse (UMDW) from the old UCP. The filename is Sysutility_mdw_<GUID\>_DATA, and the database default location is <System drive\>:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL10_50.<UCP_Name>\MSSQL\Data\\, where <System drive\> is normally the C:\ drive. For more information, see [Copy Databases with Backup and Restore](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Copy-Databases-with-Backup-and-Restore.md).  
  
5.  Restore the backup of the UMDW to the new UCP. For more information, see [Copy Databases with Backup and Restore](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Copy-Databases-with-Backup-and-Restore.md).  
  
6.  Enroll instances into the new UCP to make them managed by the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Utility. For more information, see [Enroll an Instance of SQL Server (SQL Server Utility)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Enroll-an-Instance-of-SQL-Server--SQL-Server-Utility-.md).  
  
7.  Implement custom policy definitions for the managed instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)], as necessary.  
  
8.  Wait approximately 1 hour for data collection and aggregation operations to complete.  
  
9. To refresh data, right-click the **Managed Instances** node in **Utility Explorer**, then select **Refresh**. List view data are displayed in the **Utility Explorer** content pane. For more information, see [View Resource Health Policy Results (SQL Server Utility)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/View-Resource-Health-Policy-Results--SQL-Server-Utility-.md).
