# Select a Mining Model and a Data Mining Viewer
You can explore a mining model by using one of the viewers on the **Mining Model Viewer** tab of Data Mining Designer. You can easily switch between models, or change the viewer that is used.  
  
-   The **Mining Model** drop-down list box on the **Mining Model Viewer** tab of Data Mining Designer in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)] contains a list of all the mining models that are in the current mining structure.  
  
-   Custom viewers are provided for each type of model. For an overview of all the custom viewers, see [Mining Model Viewers (Data Mining Model Designer)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Mining-Model-Viewers--Data-Mining-Model-Designer-.md). For a walkthrough of how to use the custom viewers to understand a model, see [DM Basic Tutorial](assetId:///1e00c5b9-a9f8-4503-99ee-377c9cc02d7f).  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/msCoName_md.md)] Generic Content Viewer shows the patterns discovered by the algorithm in a standard representation of nodes in a tree. Although the generic tree view shows all the content for the model in rich detail, it is more difficult to interpret. For more information, see [Browse a Model Using the Microsoft Generic Content Tree Viewer](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Browse-a-Model-Using-the-Microsoft-Generic-Content-Tree-Viewer.md).  
  
### To select a viewer type  
  
-   Select the viewer that is provided for the specific type of model that you created, using the **Viewer** list at the top of the **Mining Model Viewer** tab.  
  
-   Or, use the **Microsoft Generic Mining Content Viewer**  
  
### To select a mining model to view  
  
-   On the **Mining Model Viewer** tab in Data Mining Designer, select the mining model that you want to view from the **Mining Model** list.  
  
 The selected mining model opens in the viewer that is provided for that model type.
