# Lock a Version (Master Data Services)
In [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)], lock a version of a model to prevent changes to the model's members and their attributes.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  When a version is locked, super users and model administrators can continue to add, edit, and remove members. Other users with permission to the model can view members only.

-   You must be a model administrator. For more information, see [Administrators (Master Data Services)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Administrators--Master-Data-Services-.md).  
  
-   The version's status must be **Open**.  
  
-   You must have permission to access the Version Management functional area. For more information, see [Functional Area Permissions (Master Data Services)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Functional-Area-Permissions--Master-Data-Services-.md).
