# Merge Cells in a Data Region (Report Builder and SSRS)
You can merge cells in a data region to combine cells, improve data region appearance, or provide spanning labels for column groups and row groups.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Cells can only be merged within each area of a data region: corner, column headers, group definition (or row headers), and body. You cannot merge cells that cross area boundaries. For example, you cannot merge a cell in the data region corner area with a cell in the row group area. For more information about tablix areas, see [Tables, Matrices, and Lists (Report Builder and SSRS)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Tables--Matrices--and-Lists--Report-Builder-and-SSRS-.md).

### To merge cells in a data region  
  
1.  In the data region on the report design surface, click the first cell to merge. Holding the left mouse button down, drag vertically or horizontally to select adjacent cells. The selected cells are highlighted.  
  
2.  Right-click the selected cells and select **Merge Cells**. The selected cells are combined into a single cell.  
  
3.  Repeat steps 1 and 2 to merge other adjacent cells in a data region.
