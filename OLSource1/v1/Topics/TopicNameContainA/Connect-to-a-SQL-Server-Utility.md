# Connect to a SQL Server Utility
  Before you can connect to a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Utility, you must create a utility control point \(UCP\). For more information, see [SQL Server Utility Features and Tasks](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/SQL-Server-Utility-Features-and-Tasks.md).  
  
 To view and manage [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] resource health, use [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] \(SSMS\) to connect to a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Utility.  
  
 To connect to a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Utility through SSMS:  
  
1.  Launch SSMS.  
  
2.  In SSMS, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)].  
  
3.  Click **View** and then **Utility Explorer**.  
  
4.  In the Utility Explorer navigation pane, click ![](../../Images\Image\ImageNotContaina/Connect_to_Utility.gif "Connect_to_Utility")**Connect to Utility**.  
  
5.  In the **Connect to Server** dialog box, specify the UCP instance name, then click **Connect**.  
  
6.  View the Utility Explorer Navigation Pane to see a tree view of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] resources in the UCP.  
  
 Creating a new UCP also connects you to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Utility. For more information, see [Create a SQL Server Utility Control Point &#40;SQL Server Utility&#41;](../Topic/Create%20a%20SQL%20Server%20Utility%20Control%20Point%20\(SQL%20Server%20Utility\).md).
