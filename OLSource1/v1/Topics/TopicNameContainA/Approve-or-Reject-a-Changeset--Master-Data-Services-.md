# Approve or Reject a Changeset (Master Data Services)
A changeset is a collection of the pending changes on the master data. If the entity changes require administrator approval and a changeset is submitted for approval, you can review and then approve or reject the changeset.  
  
## Prerequisites  
  
-   You must have permission to access the **Explorer** functional area. For more information, see [Functional Area Permissions (Master Data Services)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Functional-Area-Permissions--Master-Data-Services-.md).  
  
-   You must have administrator permission for the entity.  
  
-   The entity changes must require administrator approval.  
  
-   If the changeset status is pending, you can review and then approve or reject the changeset.  
  
-   Users are not allowed to approve their own changes. If you are the entity administrator, you must assign a secondary administrator to approve your own changeset.  
  
## To approve or reject a changeset  
  
1.  On the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSmdm](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSmdm_md.md)] home page, select the model and version and then click **Explorer**.  
  
2.  Click an entity on the **Entities** menu.  
  
3.  In the right pane, select **Changesets** and double click the changeset you want to approve or reject.  
  
4.  Click **Apply** to apply the changeset and review the pending changes.  
  
5.  Click **Reject** to reject the changeset and send it back to the owner.  
  
6.  Click **Approve** to approve the changeset. The changeset is committed automatically.
