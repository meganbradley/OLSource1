# Replay to a Cursor (SQL Server Profiler)
This topic describes how to replay trace files or tables that pause when a cursor is reached by using [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSqlProfiler_md.md)]. Pausing traces at cursors supports debugging because you can break the replay of long trace scripts into short segments that can be analyzed incrementally.  
  
### To replay to the cursor  
  
1.  Open the trace file or trace table you want to replay. For more information, see [Open a Trace File (SQL Server Profiler)](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Open-a-Trace-File--SQL-Server-Profiler-.md) or [Open a Trace Table (SQL Server Profiler)](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Open-a-Trace-Table--SQL-Server-Profiler-.md).  
  
     Make sure that the trace file or table you open contains the event classes necessary for replay. For more information, see [Replay Requirements](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Replay-Requirements.md).  
  
2.  In the trace window, click an event.  
  
3.  On the **Replay** menu, click **Run to Cursor**, and then connect to the server where you want to replay the trace.  
  
4.  In the **Replay Configuration** dialog box, verify the settings, and then click **OK**.  
  
     The replay starts, pausing when the first cursor is reached.  
  
5.  Press F5 to resume the trace.  
  
6.  Repeat Step 5 through the end of the trace.
