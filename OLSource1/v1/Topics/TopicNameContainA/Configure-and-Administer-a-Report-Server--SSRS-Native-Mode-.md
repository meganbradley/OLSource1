# Configure and Administer a Report Server (SSRS Native Mode)
This topic summarizes the approaches that you can use to configure [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)]. It also includes a list of topics that explain how to configure specific components, features, or server capabilities. To configure [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)], you can:  
  
-   Use the Reporting Services Configuration Manager. Many of the topics in this section contain information about how to configure specific features through this tool.  
  
-   Use [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudio_md.md)] to customize server properties, enable My Reports, enable trace logs, and set site-wide defaults. For more information about site settings, see [Reporting Services Report Server (Native Mode)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Reporting-Services-Report-Server--Native-Mode-.md) for Management Studio. Note that you can create and run script that sets server properties programmatically. For more information, see [Script Deployment and Administrative Tasks](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Script-Deployment-and-Administrative-Tasks.md) and [Report Server System Properties](assetId:///cd874117-00e5-4ae6-8629-eb9ba9f40478).  
  
-   Use Report Manager to grant permissions to access the report server. Permissions are conveyed through role assignments that you define for each user or group account. For more information, see [Roles and Permissions (Reporting Services)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Roles-and-Permissions--Reporting-Services-.md).  
  
-   Optionally, modify configuration files to change application settings. For more information about each file and guidelines for modifying them, see [Reporting Services Configuration Files](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Reporting-Services-Configuration-Files.md).
