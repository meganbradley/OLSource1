# Configure and Administer a Report Server (SSRS Native Mode)
  This topic summarizes the approaches that you can use to configure [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssRSnoversion_md.md)]. It also includes a list of topics that explain how to configure specific components, features, or server capabilities. To configure [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssRSnoversion_md.md)], you can:  
  
-   Use the Reporting Services Configuration Manager. Many of the topics in this section contain information about how to configure specific features through this tool.  
  
-   Use [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../Token\Other/ssManStudio_md.md)] to customize server properties, enable My Reports, enable trace logs, and set site\-wide defaults. For more information about site settings, see [Reporting Services Report Server &#40;Native Mode&#41;](../Topic/Reporting%20Services%20Report%20Server%20\(Native%20Mode\).md) for Management Studio. Note that you can create and run script that sets server properties programmatically. For more information, see [Script Deployment and Administrative Tasks](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/Script-Deployment-and-Administrative-Tasks.md) andÂ [Report Server System Properties](../Topic/Report%20Server%20System%20Properties.md).  
  
-   Use Report Manager to grant permissions to access the report server. Permissions are conveyed through role assignments that you define for each user or group account. For more information, see [Roles and Permissions &#40;Reporting Services&#41;](../Topic/Roles%20and%20Permissions%20\(Reporting%20Services\).md).  
  
-   Optionally, modify configuration files to change application settings. For more information about each file and guidelines for modifying them, see [Reporting Services Configuration Files](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/Reporting-Services-Configuration-Files.md).
