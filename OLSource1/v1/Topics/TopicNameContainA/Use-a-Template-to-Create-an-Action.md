# Use a Template to Create an Action
  The **Actions** view in Cube Designer contains a number of templates that you can use to create common actions. Cube Designer can be accessed from [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)].  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  After you create the action, it will become available to users after you update or reprocess the cube. For more information, see [Processing a multidimensional model &#40;Analysis Services&#41;](../Topic/Processing%20a%20multidimensional%20model%20\(Analysis%20Services\).md).  
  
### To use a template to create an action  
  
-   Open the cube for which you want to create an action, and under **Design**, click the **Actions** tab.  
  
-   Under **Calculation Tools**, click the **Templates** tab, expand the node containing the type of action you want to create, and then double\-click the template you want to use.  
  
-   Fill in the required information to complete building the action based on the template.
