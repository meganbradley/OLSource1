# Example: Online Restore of a Read-Write File (Full Recovery Model)
This topic is relevant for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] databases under the full recovery model that contain multiple files or filegroups.  
  
 In this example, a database named `adb`, which uses the full recovery model, contains three filegroups. Filegroup `A` is read/write, and filegroup `B` and filegroup `C` are read-only. Initially, all of the filegroups are online.  
  
 File `a1` in filegroup `A` appears to be damaged, and the database administrator decides to restore it while the database remains online.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Under the simple recovery model, online restore of read/write data is not allowed.  
  
## Restore Sequences  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The syntax for an online restore sequence is the same as for an offline restore sequence.  
  
1.  Online restore of file `a1`.  
  
    ```  
    RESTORE DATABASE adb FILE='a1' FROM backup   
    WITH NORECOVERY;  
    ```  
  
     At this point, file a1 is in the RESTORING state, and filegroup A is offline.  
  
2.  After restoring the file, the database administrator takes a new log backup to make sure that the point at which the file went offline is captured.  
  
    ```  
    BACKUP LOG adb TO log_backup3;   
    ```  
  
3.  Online restore of log backups.  
  
     The administrator restores all the log backups taken since the restored file backup, ending with the latest log backup (*log_backup3*, taken in step 2). After the last backup is restored, the database is recovered.  
  
    ```  
    RESTORE LOG adb FROM log_backup1 WITH NORECOVERY;  
    RESTORE LOG adb FROM log_backup2 WITH NORECOVERY;  
    RESTORE LOG adb FROM log_backup3 WITH NORECOVERY;  
    RESTORE LOG adb WITH RECOVERY;  
    ```  
  
     File `a1` is now online.
