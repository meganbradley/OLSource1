# Open, View, and Print a Deadlock File (SQL Server Management Studio)
When [!INCLUDE[ssSqlProfiler](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssSqlProfiler_md.md)] generates a deadlock, you can capture and save the deadlock information to a file. After you have saved the deadlock file, you can open it in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] to view or print.  
  
### To open and view a deadlock file  
  
1.  On the **File** menu in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)], point to **Open**, and then click **File**.  
  
2.  In the **Open File** dialog box, select the .xdl file type in the **Files of type** box. You will now have a filtered list of only deadlock files.  
  
### To print a deadlock file  
  
1.  On the **File** menu in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)], point to **Open,** and then click **File**.  
  
2.  In the **Open File** dialog box, select the .xdl file type in the **Files of type** box. You will now have a filtered list of only deadlock files.  
  
3.  Select the deadlock file you want to print, and click **Open**.  
  
4.  On the **File** menu, click **Print.**
