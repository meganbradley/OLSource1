# Simulating an IF-WHILE EXISTS Statement in a Natively Compiled Module
Natively compiled stored procedures do not support the **EXISTS** clause in conditional statements such as IF and WHILE.  
  
 The following example illustrates a workaround using a BIT variable with a SELECT statement to simulate an EXISTS clause:  
  
```tsql  
DECLARE @exists BIT = 0  
SELECT TOP 1 @exists = 1 FROM MyTable WHERE …  
IF @exists = 1  
```
