# Connect Components in a Data Flow
This procedure describes how to connect the output of components in a data flow to other components within the same data flow.  
  
### To connect components in a data flow  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)], open the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] project that contains the package you want.  
  
2.  In Solution Explorer, double-click the package to open it.  
  
3.  Click the **Control Flow** tab, and then double-click the Data Flow task that contains the data flow in which you want to connect components.  
  
4.  On the design surface of the **Data Flow** tab, select the transformation or source that you want to connect.  
  
5.  Drag the green output arrow of a transformation or a source to a transformation or to a destination. Some data flow components have error outputs that you can connect in the same way.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Some data flow components can have multiple outputs and you can connect each output to a different transformation or destination.  
  
6.  To save the updated package, click **Save Selected Items** on the **File** menu.
