# Define a Logical Backup Device for a Disk File (SQL Server)
  This topic describes how to define a logical backup device for a disk file in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Token\Other/ssCurrent_md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Token\Other/tsql_md.md)]. A logical device is a user\-defined name that points to a specific physical backup device \(a disk file or tape drive\).  The initialization of the physical device occurs later, when a backup is written to the backup device.

     [SQL Server Management Studio](#SSMSProcedure)  
  
     [Transact\-SQL](#TsqlProcedure)  
  
##  <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before You Begin  
  
###  <a name="Restrictions"></a> Limitations and Restrictions  
  
-   The logical device name must be unique among all the logical backup devices on the server instance. To view the existing logical device names, query the [sys.backup\_devices](../Topic/sys.backup_devices%20\(Transact-SQL\).md) catalog view.  
  
###  <a name="Recommendations"></a> Recommendations  
  
-   We recommend that a backup disk be a different disk than the database data and log disks. This is necessary to make sure that you can access the backups if the data or log disk fails.  
  
###  <a name="Security"></a> Security  
  
####  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 Requires membership in the **diskadmin** fixed server role.  
  
 Requires permission to write to the disk.  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio  
  
#### To define a logical backup device for a disk file  
  
1.  After connecting to the appropriate instance of the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Token\Other/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../Token\Other/ssDEnoversion_md.md)], in Object Explorer, click the server name to expand the server tree.  
  
2.  Expand **Server Objects**, and right\-click **Backup Devices**.  
  
3.  Click **New Backup Device**. The **Backup Device** dialog box opens.  
  
4.  Enter a device name.  
  
5.  For the destination, click **File** and specify the full path of the file.  
  
6.  To define the new device, click **OK**.  
  
 To back up to this new device, add it to the **Back up to:** field in the **Back up Database** \(**General**\) dialog box. For more information, see [Create a Full Database Backup &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../Topic/Create%20a%20Full%20Database%20Backup%20\(SQL%20Server\).md).  
  
##  <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a> Using Transact\-SQL  
  
#### To define a logical backup for a disk file  
  
1.  Connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Token\Other/ssDE_md.md)].  
  
2.  From the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and clickÂ **Execute**. This example shows how to use [sp\_addumpdevice](../Topic/sp_addumpdevice%20\(Transact-SQL\).md) to define a logical backup device for a disk file. The example adds the disk backup device named `mydiskdump`, with the physical name `c:\dump\dump1.bak`.  
  
```tsql  
USE AdventureWorks2012 ;  
GO  
EXEC sp_addumpdevice 'disk', 'mydiskdump', 'c:\dump\dump1.bak' ;  
GO  
```
