# Planning a SQL Server Installation
  To install [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)], follow these steps:  
  
-   Review installation requirements, system configuration checks, and security considerations for a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] installation.  
  
-   Run [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Setup to install or upgrade to a later version. Before upgrading, review [Upgrade to SQL Server 2016](../../Topics\TopicNameNotContainA/Upgrade-to-SQL-Server-2016.md).  
  
-   Use [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)] utilities to configure [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Token\Other/ssNoVersion_md.md)].  
  
 Regardless of the installation method, you are required to confirm acceptance of the software license terms as an individual or on behalf of an entity, unless your use of the software is governed by a separate agreement such as a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Token\Other/msCoName_md.md)] volume licensing agreement or a third\-party agreement with an ISV or OEM.  
  
 The license terms are displayed for review and acceptance in the Setup user interface. Unattended installations \(using the \/Q or \/QS parameters\) must include the \/IAcceptSQLServerLicenseTerms parameter. You can review the license terms separately at [Microsoft Software License Terms](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=148209).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Depending on how you received the software \(for example, through [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../Token\Other/msCoName_md.md)] volume licensing\), your use of the software may be subject to additional terms and conditions.
