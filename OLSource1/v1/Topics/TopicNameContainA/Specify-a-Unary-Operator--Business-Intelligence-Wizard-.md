# Specify a Unary Operator (Business Intelligence Wizard)
  Use the **Specify a Unary Operator** page to identify the parent\-child relationship for the column that contains either a unary operator \(for regular aggregations\) or a value representing a weight factor \(for weighted aggregations.\) For more information about regular and weighted aggregations, see [Aggregations and Aggregation Designs](../Topic/Aggregations%20and%20Aggregation%20Designs.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This page does not appear if the Business Intelligence Wizard was started from Dimension Designer or by right\-clicking a dimension in Solution Explorer in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)].  
  
## Options  
 **Key attribute**

 **Parent attribute**  
 Displays the parent attribute with which to associate the source column that contains the unary operator or weight factor.  
  
 **Source column**
