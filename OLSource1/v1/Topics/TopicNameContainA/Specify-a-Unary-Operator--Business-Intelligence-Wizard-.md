# Specify a Unary Operator (Business Intelligence Wizard)
Use the **Specify a Unary Operator** page to identify the parent-child relationship for the column that contains either a unary operator (for regular aggregations) or a value representing a weight factor (for weighted aggregations.) For more information about regular and weighted aggregations, see [Dimension Designer (Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data)](assetId:///35bd8589-39fa-4e0b-b28f-5a07d70da0a2).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This page does not appear if the Business Intelligence Wizard was started from Dimension Designer or by right-clicking a dimension in Solution Explorer in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)].
