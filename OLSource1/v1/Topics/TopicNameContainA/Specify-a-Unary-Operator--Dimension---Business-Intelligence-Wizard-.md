# Specify a Unary Operator (Dimension) (Business Intelligence Wizard)
  Use the **Specify a Unary Operator** page to select a dimension that has a parent attribute defined and to which the Business Intelligence Wizard will apply unary operators. For more information about parent attributes, see [Attributes and Attribute Hierarchies](../Topic/Attributes%20and%20Attribute%20Hierarchies.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This page does not appear if the Business Intelligence Wizard was started from Dimension Designer or by right\-clicking a dimension in Solution Explorer in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Token\Other/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)].  
  
## Options  
 **Dimension**  
 Select the dimension that contains a parent attribute and to which the wizard will apply unary operators.
