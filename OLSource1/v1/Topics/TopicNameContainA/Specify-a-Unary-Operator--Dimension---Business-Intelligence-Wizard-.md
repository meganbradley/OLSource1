# Specify a Unary Operator (Dimension) (Business Intelligence Wizard)
Use the **Specify a Unary Operator** page to select a dimension that has a parent attribute defined and to which the Business Intelligence Wizard will apply unary operators. For more information about parent attributes, see [Dimension Designer (Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data)](assetId:///59de1ea2-e7a9-4a53-9ee0-14be52e95643).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This page does not appear if the Business Intelligence Wizard was started from Dimension Designer or by right-clicking a dimension in Solution Explorer in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssBIDevStudioFull_md.md)].  
  
## Options  
 **Dimension**  
 Select the dimension that contains a parent attribute and to which the wizard will apply unary operators.
