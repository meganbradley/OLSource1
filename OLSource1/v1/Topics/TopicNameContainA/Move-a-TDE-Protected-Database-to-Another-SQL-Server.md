# Move a TDE Protected Database to Another SQL Server
This topic describes how to to protect a database by using transparent data encryption (TDE), and then move the database to another instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/tsql_md.md)]. TDE performs real-time I/O encryption and decryption of the data and log files. The encryption uses a database encryption key (DEK), which is stored in the database boot record for availability during recovery. The DEK is a symmetric key secured by using a certificate stored in the **master** database of the server or an asymmetric key protected by an EKM module.

##  <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before You Begin  
  
###  <a name="Restrictions"></a> Limitations and Restrictions  
  
-   When moving a TDE protected database, you must also move the certificate or asymmetric key that is used to open the DEK. The certificate or asymmetric key must be installed in the **master** database of the destination server, so that [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] can access the database files. For more information, see [Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Transparent-Data-Encryption--TDE-.md).  
  
-   You must retain copies of both the certificate file and the private key file in order to recover the certificate. The password for the private key does not have to be the same as the database master key password.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] stores the files created here in **C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL13.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA** by default. Your file names and locations might be different.  
  
###  <a name="Security"></a> Security  
  
####  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
  
-   Requires **CONTROL DATABASE** permission on the **master** database to create the database master key.  
  
-   Requires **CREATE CERTIFICATE** permission on the **master** database to create the certificate that protects the DEK.  
  
-   Requires **CONTROL DATABASE** permission on the encrypted database and **VIEW DEFINITION** permission on the certificate or asymmetric key that is used to encrypt the database encryption key.  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> To create a database protected by transparent data encryption  
  
###  <a name="SSMSCreate"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio  
  
1.  Create a database master key and certificate in the **master** database. For more information, see **Using Transact-SQL** below.  
  
2.  Create a backup of the server certificate in the **master** database. For more information, see **Using Transact-SQL** below.  
  
3.  In Object Explorer, right-click the **Databases** folder and select **New Database**.  
  
4.  In the **New Database** dialog box, in the **Database name** box, enter the name of the new database.  
  
5.  In the **Owner** box, enter the name of the new database's owner. Alternately, click the ellipsis **(…)** to open the **Select Database Owner** dialog box. For more information on creating a new database, see [Create a Database](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Create-a-Database.md).  
  
6.  In Object Explorer, click the plus sign to expand the **Databases** folder.  
  
7.  Right-click the database you created, point to **Tasks**, and select **Manage Database Encryption**.  
  
     The following options are available on the **Manage Database Encryption** dialog box.  
  
     **Encryption Algorithm**  
     Displays or sets the algorithm to use for database encryption. **AES128** is the default algorithm. This field cannot be blank. For more information on encryption algorithms, see [Choose an Encryption Algorithm](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Choose-an-Encryption-Algorithm.md).  
  
     **Use server certificate**  
     Sets the encryption to be secured by a certificate. Select one from the list. If you do not have the **VIEW DEFINITION** permission on server certificates, this list will be empty. If a certificate method of encryption is selected, this value cannot be empty. For more information about certificates, see [SQL Server Certificates and Asymmetric Keys](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/SQL-Server-Certificates-and-Asymmetric-Keys.md).  
  
     **Use server asymmetric key**  
     Sets the encryption to be secured by an asymmetric key. Only available asymmetric keys are displayed. Only an asymmetric key protected by an EKM module can encrypt a database using TDE.  
  
     **Set Database Encryption On**  
     Alters the database to turn on (checked) or turn off (unchecked) TDE.  
  
8.  When finished, click **OK**.  
  
###  <a name="TsqlCreate"></a> Using Transact-SQL  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssDE_md.md)].  
  
2.  On the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**.  
  
    ```  
    -- Create a database master key and a certificate in the master database.  
    USE master ;  
    GO  
    CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = '*rt@40(FL&dasl1';  
    GO  
    CREATE CERTIFICATE TestSQLServerCert   
    WITH SUBJECT = 'Certificate to protect TDE key'  
    GO  
    -- Create a backup of the server certificate in the master database.  
    -- The following code stores the backup of the certificate and the private key file in the default data location for this instance of SQL Server   
    -- (C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL13.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\DATA).  
  
    BACKUP CERTIFICATE TestSQLServerCert   
    TO FILE = 'TestSQLServerCert'  
    WITH PRIVATE KEY   
    (  
        FILE = 'SQLPrivateKeyFile',  
        ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = '*rt@40(FL&dasl1'  
    );  
    GO  
    -- Create a database to be protected by TDE.  
    CREATE DATABASE CustRecords ;  
    GO  
    -- Switch to the new database.  
    -- Create a database encryption key, that is protected by the server certificate in the master database.   
    -- Alter the new database to encrypt the database using TDE.  
    USE CustRecords;  
    GO  
    CREATE DATABASE ENCRYPTION KEY  
    WITH ALGORITHM = AES_128  
    ENCRYPTION BY SERVER CERTIFICATE TestSQLServerCert;  
    GO  
    ALTER DATABASE CustRecords  
    SET ENCRYPTION ON;  
    GO  
    ```
