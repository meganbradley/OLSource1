# Lay out a Reporting Services mobile report for phone or tablet
Now that you've [created your Reporting Services mobile report](../../Topics\TopicNameContainA/Create-a-Reporting-Services-mobile-report.md) in [!INCLUDE[SS_MobileReptPub_Short](../../Token\Other/SS_MobileReptPub_Long.md)], you can lay out a phone and tablet version of it.  
  
![SSMRP_SalesTrendRptLayout](../../Images\Image\ImageNotContaina/SSMRP_SalesTrendRptLayout.png)   
*The master layout for the mobile report.*  
  
1. In the upper-right corner of [!INCLUDE[SS_MobileReptPub_Short](../../Token\Other/SS_MobileReptPub_Short.md)], select the layout icon > either **Phone** or **Tablet**.  
  
   ![SSMRP_LayoutMenu](../../Images\Image\ImageNotContaina/SSMRP_LayoutMenu.png)  
     
   The phone layout grid opens. All the visualizations are on the **Layout** tab.
